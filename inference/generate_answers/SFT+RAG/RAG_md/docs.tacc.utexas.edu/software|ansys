# ANSYS at TACC

*Last update: June 12, 2024*

|  | ANSYS offers a comprehensive software suite that spans the entire range of physics, providing access to virtually any field of engineering simulation that a design process requires. ANSYS software is used to simulate computer models of structures, electronics, or machine components for analyzing strength, toughness, elasticity, temperature distribution, electromagnetism, fluid flow, and other attributes. |
| --- | --- |

ANSYS is currently installed on TACC's [Frontera](../../hpc/frontera), [Lonestar6](../../hpc/lonestar6) and [Stampede3](../../hpc/stampede3) resources.

## Licenses

TACC's current ANSYS license allows TACC users to access ANSYS for **non-commercial**, **academic** use. If you would like access to ANSYS, [submit a help desk ticket](https://tacc.utexas.edu/about/help/ "Help Desk"). Include in your ticket your institutional affiliation and a brief statement confirming that you will use ANSYS only for **non-commercial**, **academic** purposes. If you are affiliated with the University of Texas, include your academic department in your help desk ticket.

If you have your own ANSYS licenses or would like to install your own copy, you are allowed to do so.

## Installations

ANSYS is currently installed under `/home1/apps/ANSYS` on TACC's Frontera and Stampede3, and `/scratch/tacc/apps/ANSYS` on TACC's Lonestar6 resources. Installations on Frontera and Stampede3 include the main components: Structures, Fluids, Electronics and LS-Dyna. However, installations on Lonestar6 only include Structures, Fluids and LS-Dyna. Electronics is not included since it is not supported on LS6â€™s operating system. All packages are installed under the default locations based on the ANSYS naming convention. Table

### Table 1. Installations at TACC

| Resource | ANSYS Version | Components | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontera | 2023R2 | Structures, Fluids, Electronics, LS-Dyna | `/home1/apps/ANSYS/2023R2/v232``/home1/apps/ANSYS/2023R2/AnsysEM` |
| Stampede3 | 2024R1 | Structures, Fluids, LS-Dyna | `/home1/apps/ANSYS/2024R1/v241` |
| Lonestar6 | 2023R2 | Structures, Fluids, LS-Dyna | `/scratch/tacc/apps/ANSYS/2023R2/v232` |

## Running ANSYS

### Interactive Mode

ANSYS can be launched with the ANSYS GUI used in interactive mode. Use the [TACC Analysis Portal](https://tap.tacc.utexas.edu/) or create a VNC session following the directions in the [Remote Desktop Access](../../hpc/stampede3#vis-remote) section.

Caution

Do NOT launch ANSYS, or any other codes, on the login nodes.

ANSYS is managed under [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Environmental Module System on TACC resources. Within the VNC session, load the ANSYS module with the following command:

```
$ module load ansys
```

You can always get the help information using the module's "`help`" command:

```
$ module help ansys
```

Launch the ANSYS GUI within the VNC session:

```
$ /home1/apps/ANSYS/2023R2/v232/ansys/bin/launcher232
```

### Batch Mode

You can also submit your ANSYS job to the batch nodes (compute nodes) on TACC resources. To do so, first make sure that the ANSYS module has been loaded, and then launch your ANSYS programs as shown in the sample Frontera job script below.

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J ansysjob              # job name
#SBATCH -e ansysjob.%j.err       # error file name 
#SBATCH -o ansysjob.%j.out       # output file name 
#SBATCH -N 1                     # request 1 node
#SBATCH -n 56                    # request 56 cores 
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00              # designate max run time 
#SBATCH -A myproject             # charge job to myproject 
#SBATCH -p normal                # designate queue 

module load ansys
# Your-ANSYS-COMMAND-HERE

# Define your working directory
MY_JOB_DIR = /scratch1/01234/joe/Ansys_test

# Run ANSYS Job
"/home1/apps/ANSYS/2023R2/v232/ansys/bin/mapdl" \
        -p ansys -dis -mpi INTELMPI -np 56 -lch    \
        -dir "$MY_JOB_DIR" \
        -j "Ansys_test" -s read -l en-us -b \
        &lt; "$MY_JOB_DIR/Ansys_test_input.txt" &gt; "$MY_JOB_DIR/Ansys_test_output.out"
```

To obtain the correct `Your-ANSYS-COMMAND-HERE`, launch the ANSYS GUI used in interactive mode. Here, we use the ANSYS Mechanical APDL as an example. After entering the correct *Working directory*, *Job Name*, *Input File*, *Output File*, and *Number of Processors*, you can click Tools and then Display Command Line to get the complete command to run ANSYS jobs in batch mode. No `ibrun` or `mpirun` command is needed for running ANSYS jobs.

Other ANSYS binaries, e.g. Aqwa, CFX, Fluent, can be found at `/home1/apps/ANSYS/2023R2/v232`.
