# Data Transfer

*Last update: August 15, 2024*

This guide will outline and instruct methods of transferring data between TACC resources and and your local machine. Transfer methods generally fall into two categories:

1. Command-line (CLI) tools e.g. `scp`, `sftp`, `rsync`
2. Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools, e.g. [Globus](#globus), Cyberduck

## Command-Line Tools

A common method of transferring files between TACC resources and/or your local machine is through the command line. Whether on a Windows or a Mac, open the terminal applicaton on your local laptop to use one of the following Unix command-line (CLI) tools.

These three command line tools are secure and can be used to accomplish data transfer. You can run these commands directly from the terminal if your local system runs Linux or macOS: `scp`, `sftp`, & `rsync`

Note

It is possible to use these command line tools if your local machine runs Windows, but you will need to use a ssh client (ex. [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)).

To simplify the data transfer process, we recommend that Windows users follow the [How to Transfer Data with Cyberduck](#datatransfer-cyberduck) guide as detailed below.

### Determining Paths

Before beginning data transfer with command-line tools, you will need to know:

* the path to your data file(s) on your local system
* the path to your transfer directory on the remote system

In order to transfer your project data, you will first need to know where the files are located on your local system.

To do so, navigate to the location of the files on your computer. This can be accomplished on a Mac by using the Finder application or on Windows with File Explorer application. Common locations for user data at the user's home directory, the Desktop and My Documents.

Once you have identified the location of the files, you can right-click on them and select either Get Info (on Mac) or Properties (on Windows) to view the path location on your local system.

Figure 1. Use Get Info to determine "Where" the path of your data file(s) is

 Figure 1. Use Get Info to determine "Where" the path of your data file(s) is

For example, a file located in a folder named portal-data under `Documents` would have the following path:

| On Mac | /Users/username/Documents/portal-data/my\_file.txt |
| --- | --- |
On Windows| \Users\username\My Documents\portal-data\my\_file.txt |

### Transfer with `scp`

The `scp` command copies files between hosts on a network. To transfer a file (ex. `my_file.txt`) to the remote secure system via `scp`, open a terminal on your local computer and navigate to the path where your data file is located.

| On Mac | localhost$ cd ~/Documents/portal-data/ |
| --- | --- |
| On Windows | localhost$ cd %HOMEPATH%\Documents\portal-data\ |

Assuming your TACC username is `bjones` and you are affiliated with UT Austin, a `scp` transfer that pushes `my_file.txt` from the current directory of your local computer to the remote secure system would look like this:

This command will copy your data file directly to your individualized transfer directory on the remote storage system.

```
localhost$ scp ./my_file.txt bjones@host:/transfer/directory/path
```

*If you have not done so already, enter this command in your terminal, replacing the file name, TACC username, and your individualized transfer directory path appropriately.*

After entering the command, you will be prompted to login to the remote secure system by entering the password associated with your TACC account as well as the token value generated from your TACC token app.

A successful data transfer will generate terminal output similar to this:

```
my_file.txt     100% ##  #.#          KB/s   ##:##g
```
### Transfer with `sftp`

`sftp` is a file transfer program that allows you to interactively navigate between your local file system and the remote secure system. To transfer a file (ex. `my_file.txt`) to the remote secure system via `sftp`, open a terminal on your local computer and navigate to the path where your data file is located.

| On Mac | localhost$ cd ~/Documents/portal-data/ |
| --- | --- |
| On Windows | localhost$ cd %HOMEPATH%\Documents\portal-data\ |

Assuming your TACC username is `bjones` and you are affiliated with UT Austin, an `sftp` transfer that pushes `my_file.txt` from the current directory of your local computer to the remote secure system would look like this:

```
localhost$ sftp bjones@host:/transfer/directory/path
Password:
TACC Token Code:
Connected to host.
Changing to:
  /transfer/directory/path
sftp>
```

If you have not done so already, enter this command in your terminal, replacing the TACC username `bjones` and your individualized transfer directory path appropriately.

Once you've logged into the remote secure system and have been redirected to your transfer directory, confirm your location on the server:

```
sftp> pwd
Remote working directory:
/transfer/directory/path
```

To list the files currently in your transfer directory:

```
sftp> ls
utaustin_dir.txt
```

To list the files currently in your *local* directory:

```
sftp> lls
my_file.txt
```

Tip

The leading `l` in the `lls` command denotes that you are listing the contents of your *local* working directory.

To transfer `my_file.txt` from your local computer to your transfer directory:

```
sftp> put my_file.txt
Uploading my_file.txt to /transfer/directory/path
my_file.txt     100% ##  #.#          KB/s   ##:#
```

To check if `my_file.txt` is in the `utaustin` subfolder:

```
sftp> ls
my_file.txt
utaustin_dir.txt
```

To exit out of `sftp` on the terminal:

```
sftp> bye
localhost1$
```

If you wish to learn more about `sftp`, you can do so at [the online man page for scp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sftp.1.html).

### Transfer with `rsync`

`rsync`is a file copying tool that can reduce the amount of data transferred by sending only the differences between the source files on your local system and the existing files in your transfer directory. To transfer a file (ex. `my_file.txt`) to the remote secure system via `rsync`, open a terminal on your local computer and navigate to the path where your data file is located.

| On Mac | localhost$ cd ~/Documents/portal-data/ |
| --- | --- |
| On Windows | localhost$ cd %HOMEPATH%\Documents\portal-data\ |

Assuming your TACC username is `bjones` and you are affiliated with UT Austin, an `rsync` transfer that pushes `my_file.txt` from the current directory of your local computer to the remote secure system would look like this:

```
localhost$ rsync ./my_file.txt bjones@host:/transfer/directory/path
```

If you have not done so already, enter this command in your terminal, replacing the TACC username and your individualized transfer directory path appropriately.

If the command returns 0 in your terminal, the data transfer was successful.

If you wish to learn more about `rsync` and how to synchronize your file transfer, you can do so [the online `man` page for `rsync`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rsync.1.html) or follow the file transfer section of the user guide for the appropriate TACC system:

Consult Figure 4. above to ensure the information you have provided is correct. *If you have not done so already, replace the "Path" with the path to your individualized transfer directory.*

Note

You will be prompted to "allow unknown fingerprint" upon connection. Select "allow" and then enter your TACC token value.

Once connected, you can navigate through your remote file hierarchy using the graphical user interface. You may also drag-and-drop files from your local computer into the Cyberduck window to transfer files to the storage system.

## UTBox and other Third-Party Storage Services

Unfortunately TACC does not allow direct access from UT Box or other third-party storage services such as Dropbox, Google or Amazon storage services. To transfer files from one of these services:

1. Manually download the files from one of these services to your laptop
2. Using one of the tools outlined in this document (e.g. `scp` or Cyberduck), upload the files from your laptop to the desired TACC resource (e.g. Stampede3, Frontera).

If you have files stored at another university, see the [Globus instructions](#globus) below.

## Globus Data Transfer Guide

Last update: *August 30, 2024*

Globus supplies high speed, reliable, asynchronous transfers to the portal. Globus is fast, for large volumes of data, as it uses multiple network sockets simultaneously to transfer data. It is reliable for large numbers of directories and files, as it can automatically fail and restart itself, and will only notify you when the transfers are completed successfully.

This document leads you through the steps required to set up Globus to use for the first time. Several steps will need to be repeated each time you set up a new computer to use Globus for the portal. Once you are set up, you can use Globus not only for transfers to and from the portal, but also to access other cyberinfrastructure resources at TACC and around the world.

To start using Globus, you need to do two things: Generate a unique identifier, an ePPN (an acronym-to not-worry-about), for all Globus services, and enroll the machine you are transferring data to/from with Globus. This can be your personal laptop or desktop, or a server to which you have access. Follow this one-time process to set up the Globus file transfer capability.

Tip

ePPN is an unfortunate acronym for "**e**du**P**erson**P**rincipal**N**ame", an identifier indicating a unique person within an LDAP schema.

Note

**Globus Transition**. Globus has transitioned to version 5.4. This transition impacts all TACC researchers who use Globus and requires you to update your profile with an ePPN to continue using the Globus service. The use of "Distinguished Names", or DNs, is no longer supported.

Important

You must use your institution's credentials and **not your personal email account (e.g. Google, Yahoo!, Hotmail)** when setting up Globus. You will encounter problems with the transfer endpoints (e.g. Frontera, Stampede3, Corral, Ranch) if you use your personal account information.

### Step 1. **Retrieve your Unique ePPN**.

**Retrieve your Unique ePPN**. Login to [CILogon](https://cilogon.org) and click on "User Attributes". Make note of your ePPN.

Figure 1. Make note of your ePPN

### Step 2. **Associate your EPPN with your TACC Account.**

**Associate your EPPN with your TACC Account.** Login to your [TACC user profile](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu), click "Account Information" in the left-hand menu, then add or edit your ePPN from Step 1.

Important

If you update your ePPN, please allow up to 2 hours for the changes to propagate across the systems.

### Step 3. **Globus File Manager**

Once you've completed these steps, you will be able to use the [Globus File Manager](https://app.globus.org) as usual. If you encounter any issues, please [submit a support ticket](https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/tickets).
