I joined the TACC team in June 2023 as a Project Coordinator. In this role, I am responsible for overseeing the execution and tracking of critical projects and ensuring their successful delivery. Prior to joining TACC, I worked as a Technical Program Manager at Google, where I led the execution of one of Google's largest internal products and drove cross-functional initiatives resulting in significant cost savings.
