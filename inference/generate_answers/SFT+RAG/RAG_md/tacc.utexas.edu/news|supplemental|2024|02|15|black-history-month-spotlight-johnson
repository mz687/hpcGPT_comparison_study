The [WeTeach\_CS](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/) program at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) partners with educators and administrators across Texas to educate, empower, and inspire K-12 teachers and advocates to realize the vision of computer science (CS) for all.

[Michael A. Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-a-johnson-b4b82775/) is a Career and Technical Education (CTE) Business Technology/Computer Applications Instructor for Houston ISD and Houston Community College. Previously, Johnson worked as an AP CS teacher for Houston ISD.

We caught up with Johnson to hear about his experiences as a Black person working in CS, his perspective on the WeTeach\_CS program, and the importance of teaching CS in schools.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What inspired you to work in CS education? Was it a dearth of Black teachers in CS classrooms?

**Michael A. Johnson:** Whether we realize it or not, computer science affects our everyday lives. Social media and digital technologies like smartphones, the Internet, and various devices are integral to our daily routines. Without CS, these technologies and future innovations wouldn’t be possible. Being a CS educator gives me the opportunity to engage with students — including those most often underrepresented — not only about technical aspects like programming and logic but also about how and why CS has the potential to shape our thoughts, influence our feelings, and impact our decisions.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** How did you first learn about the WeTeach\_CS program?

**Michael A. Johnson:** I was a first-year CS teacher using Code.org curriculum when CSTA’s Director of Education Shaina Glass introduced me to WeTeach\_CS programs and initiatives. Later, I met the WeTeach\_CS team’s Amy Carrell while participating in a Code.org summer workshop. As a result, I’ve been able to network and learn from so many CS/STEM educators, and industry professionals.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What advice would you give a Black teacher new to teaching computer science/STEM?

**Michael A. Johnson:** It’s OK to not know everything. It takes time to learn content, develop a routine, and gain confidence. Being a teacher has its challenges, so give yourself some grace. Be vulnerable and admit when you don’t have all the answers. Students will appreciate this and will be more inclined to explore together. Identify a good teacher mentor early on, whether on or off campus and preferably in a STEM area. Most importantly, know that you will be viewed as a role model. You might be the only Black teacher your students will ever have, so your approach in developing your skill set, building relationships, and helping students accomplish their goals will have a lasting impact.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Why should Black teachers consider WeTeach\_CS as a program and philosophy?

**Michael A. Johnson:** The WeTeach\_CS team is committed to expanding the CS teacher pipeline, diversifying the CS teacher pool, and supporting growth and expansion of opportunities for teachers in rural and difficult-to-staff areas. The team builds partnerships with professionals in education and industry to develop curriculum, increase student engagement, provide teacher training, and embrace the idea of broadening participation and access for every student. This inclusive outlook especially applies to those often overlooked and marginalized, such as individuals with low socioeconomic status, Black and Hispanic communities, and those with disabilities.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:**Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Mr. Johnson.

WeTeach\_CS is part of The University of Texas at Austin’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) group within TACC, which works to advance CS education for all in Texas and beyond.

Are you an educator thinking about earning a CS teaching certification? The WeTeach\_CS [Certification Incentive Program](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/) provides a $1,000 stipend to any Texas educator who earns their certification. This stipend represents a small “thank you” to the educators bringing CS to a diverse range of students.

Explore the state of CS education at your school and in your district with the [Texas CS Education Data Dashboard](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/data-dashboard/) from the EPIC research team. The dashboard offers an interactive look at CS enrollment rates, access equity, and more.
