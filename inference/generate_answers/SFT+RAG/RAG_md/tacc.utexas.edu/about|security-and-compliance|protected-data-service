# Protected Data Service

## We support the most common security control requirements needed by researchers and reduce the workload to satisfy these requirements. Follow the steps below to get started.

TACC has developed an extensive compliance program, enabling some of the largest open science systems in the world to be used by researchers faced with the prospect of conducting research using sensitive information. TACC's Protected Data Service (PDS) supports standard security control needs that require safeguarding sensitive data used by researchers reducing the workload for individuals and research teams to satisfy these security needs.

### Project Approval Pending

Approval for the project is done after all required documentation is received by TACC.

---

### Request Allocation

When approved, you will receive an email directing you to request an allocation on TACC's systems. This will include both corral-secure for storage and a computational system for compute resources.

---

### Get Working!

Once the allocation is approved, the corral-secure data allocation is created, you will be sent instructions on how to access this data storage area and also how to run using the protected data allocations as it is separate queues, etc.
