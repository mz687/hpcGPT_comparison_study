# Getting Started

## TACC offers access to a variety of computing resources and consulting services.

TACC provides access to resources capable of high performance computing, visualization, and large scale data analysis. We also offer multiple storage solutions that enable users to store and access data for research and modeling. Cloud and portal services further increase the ways in which users can interact with TACC and advance their work.

Every day, TACC staff work with hundreds of researchers enabling them to develop new medicine, explore renewable energy sources, and visualize astronomical phenomena. But TACC isn’t just for scientists and engineers, TACC resources are used by industry partners, humanities scholars, K-12 educators, and more.

TACC aims to provide the best computing experience possible for all levels of users and all fields of research.
