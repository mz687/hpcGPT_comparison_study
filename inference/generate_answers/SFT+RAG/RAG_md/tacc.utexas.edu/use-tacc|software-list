# Software List

## TACC Maintains A Collection Of Software Packages And Libraries To Support Advanced Computing Activities Across Multiple Disciplines.

Researchers are welcome to install third-party software in their own accounts, but TACC installs/maintains collections and libraries that may already meet user requirements. We consider quality, currency, performance, system compatibility, and benefit to the scientific community when making decisions regarding new or upgrade installations.

#### Request a New Package

Help us gauge interest in potential future installations. If there’s a software package you’d find useful, please let us know by [submitting a ticket](/about/help/).

#### BioContainers

The BioContainers project provides the infrastructure and basic guidelines to create, manage and distribute Bioinformatics containers with special focus in Proteomics, Genomics, Transcriptomics and Metabolomics. Browse and search the BioContainer modules available on TACC’s HPC compute resources.
