# Joe Stubbs, Ph.D.

## Manager Cloud & Interactive Computing (CIC)

Phone: **512-475-9411** |
Email: **[jstubbs@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:jstubbs@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Joe leads the Cloud and Interactive Computing group at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which builds and maintains national-scale cloud computing platforms and distributed systems for advanced research computing. He is the PI of multiple NSF-funded projects, including the Tapis API framework, and he leads TACC’s involvement in the ICICLE AI Institute. He also teaches courses and mentors students in the Computational Engineering program within the Cockrell School of Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. His teaching focuses on software engineering, scalable distributed systems design and machine learning.

Prior to joining the University of Texas, Joe received a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Texas, Austin and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Michigan. His research interests include cloud and distributed computing, software engineering, security, machine learning, and formal methods.
