## New Stampede3 Advances NSF Supercomputing Ecosystem

Stampede3 is the newest strategic resource for the nation’s open science community since entering full production in 2024.

TACC’s powerful Dell Technologies and Intel based supercomputer will enable groundbreaking open science research projects in the U.S. while leveraging the nation’s previous HPC investment funds. For over a decade, the Stampede systems — Stampede (2012) and Stampede2 (2017) — have been flagships in the U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF) ACCESS ecosystem. Stampede3 will be the only system in the NSF [ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) environment to integrate the new Intel Max Series GPUs.

The system will also include first-class operations, user support and training, education, outreach, documentation, data management, visualization, analytics-driven application support, and research collaboration.

Stampede3 is funded by the NSF Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) through [award 2320757](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2320757).

### System Specifications

| A new four petaflop capability for high-end simulation: 560 new Intel® Xeon® CPU Max Series processors with high bandwidth memory-enabled nodes, adding 63,000 cores for the largest, most performance-intensive compute jobs. |
| --- |
| A new graphics processing unit/AI subsystem including 10 Dell PowerEdge XE9640 servers adding 40 new Intel® Data Center GPU Max Series processors for AI/ML and other GPU-friendly applications. |
| Reintegration of 224 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor nodes for higher memory applications (added to Stampede2 in 2021). |
| Legacy hardware to support throughput computing — more than 1,000 existing Stampede2 2nd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processor nodes will be incorporated into the new system to support high-throughput computing, interactive workloads, and other smaller workloads. |
| The new Omni-Path Fabric 400 Gb/s technology offering highly scalable performance through a network interconnect with 24 TB/s backplane bandwidth to enable low latency, excellent scalability for applications, and high connectivity to the I/O subsystem. |
| 1,858 compute nodes with more than 140,000 cores, more than 330 terabytes of RAM, 13 petabytes of new storage, and almost 10 petaflops of peak capability. |
