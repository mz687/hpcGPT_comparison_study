Stephen Lien Harrell joined TACC in 2020 as an Engineering Scientist in the HPC Performance and Architectures Group at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. He is primarily focused on benchmarking tools and infrastructure for performance analysis. Previously, Stephen spent more than 6 years as a Senior Computational Scientist in the Research Computing group and 6 years before that in the HPC Systems group at Purdue. Stephen has been involved in reproducibility efforts at the SC conference series and is the chair for the ACM SIGHPC Computational and Data Science Fellowship.
