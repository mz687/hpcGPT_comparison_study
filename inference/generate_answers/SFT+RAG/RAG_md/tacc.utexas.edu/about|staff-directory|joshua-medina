I am recent graduate of Texas State University where I obtained my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. I joined TACC in January of 2023 as a Research Software Engineering intern. I worked on a complete reconstruction of TACC’s very own drug discovery portal. Additionally, I worked on numerous applications the Life Sciences group offers to TACC users. My new role at TACC will support the Enterprise Software team as a software engineer to redesign the TACC Allocation System.
