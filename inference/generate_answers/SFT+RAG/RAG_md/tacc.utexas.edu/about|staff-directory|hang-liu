Hang Liu is a research associate in TACC's High Performance Computing group. His research focuses on algorithm development, implementation, validation and performance optimization to suite large scale nuclear physics calculations on modern HPC architectures. Prior to TACC, he worked as a physicist at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University where he collaborated with scientists in the conversion of nuclear physics codes to run on parallel HPC facilities, and helped to develop new codes of common interest in support of NSCL research programs.
