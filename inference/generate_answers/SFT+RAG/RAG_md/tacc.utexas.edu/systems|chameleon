# Chameleon

## Reconfigurable Large-Scale OpenStack Cloud Tested for Computer Science and Networking Research

Chameleon is a large-scale, deeply reconfigurable experimental platform built to support Computer Sciences systems research. Community projects range from systems research developing new operating systems, virtualization methods, performance variability studies, and power management research to projects in software defined networking, artificial intelligence, and resource management.
To support experiments of this type, Chameleon has adapted OpenStack to support a bare metal reconfiguration system giving users full control of the software stack including root privileges, kernel customization, and console access.

A virtualization subsystem provides finer-grained resource sharing, balanced against the coarse-grained and stronger isolation properties of bare metal.
For even more flexibility, a Liqid composable infrastructure subsystem has been added, hosting 10 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and 16 4TB Samsung NVMe drives that can be assigned in any combination to 8 compute nodes.

Chameleon is supported by awards from the National Science Foundation: [CNS-1419152](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1419152&HistoricalAwards=false), [CNS-1743354](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1743354&HistoricalAwards=false).
