# Plasma Turbulence

### Science Behind the Image

These computer generated graphics are visualizations of data from a simulation of plasma turbulence in Earth's ionosphere. These same physics are also applied to the research team's investigations of turbulence in the tokamak, a device used in nuclear fusion experiments.

### Visualization Behind the Image

Wendell Horton and Lee Leonard use TACC's Stampede computing system to run their simulation which produces the data in these visualizations. Some of the visualizations are also produced with Stampede.
