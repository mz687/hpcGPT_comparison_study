### Travel & Participation Stipend

To broaden participation in the TACCSTER 2023 symposium from around the State of Texas, we are supporting up to **six** Travel and Participation Stipends for up to **$1,500** each. The stipends are intended to cover registration, travel, and accommodation expenses incurred for attending TACCSTER 2023 in Austin. Stipend recipients will be expected to give a 15-20 minute **Platform Talk** on their TACC-related work in a dedicated session at the symposium. Travel assistance is provided by the NSF CC\* project SWEETER award number [#1925764](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1925764). [SWEETER](https://hprc.tamu.edu/sweeter/) provides training and support for your computational research.

**Eligibility:** The Travel & Participation Stipends are available to Undergraduate and Graduate Students who will be enrolled in institutions of higher education in the State of Texas at the time of the symposium. Priority will be given to those who may not otherwise be able to attend without receiving the Travel & Participation Stipend.

**To apply, please send an email to [taccster@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:taccster@tacc.utexas.edu) including:**

* The subject line "Submission for Travel and Participation Stipend"
* Your name, year / level of study (e.g. "3rd year graduate student"), and university / department affiliation in the body of the email
* A short abstract (max 300 words) containing a title, names and affiliations of all authors and coauthors, and description of the work you would like to present
* A short personal statement (max 300 words) describing how it will be helpful to your future career goals to attend and present at TACCSTER

Please provide the abstract and personal statement in a single PDF file. All materials will be de-identified, then reviewed by a panel of scientists, scholars, and educators. **The application deadline is August 23, 2023 by 5:00pm Central Time.**

### Poster Presentations & Lightning Talks

TACCSTER is accepting abstracts to be considered for a poster presentation at the symposium. Abstracts should highlight original research or related activities performed on TACC systems (any field of study). To be considered for a poster presentation, **please submit a title, list of authors and affiliations, and a short abstract (300 words max) describing the work in a single Word Document or PDF to [taccster@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:taccster@tacc.utexas.edu) by August 23, 2023.** Please include "Submission for Poster Presentation" in the subject line. Presenters will be notified of acceptance by August 28, 2023.

Abstracts submitted for poster presentation will be assessed on their overall content, impact, and relevance to TACC. Limited exceptional submissions will be invited to give a lightning talk in addition to a poster. Lightning talks will be no longer than five minutes (slides must be e-mailed to [taccster@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:taccster@tacc.utexas.edu) by September 25, 2023). Poster presenters will be evaluated by a panel of judges on their overall content, impact, relevance to TACC, and the effectiveness of their communication. Select presentations will be highlighted on the TACC website following the symposium.

### One-on-One Sessions with TACC Experts

There will be opportunities for registered symposium attendees to meet one-on-one with TACC staff and domain experts. If you would like to arrange a meeting, please email a short summary (2-3 sentences) of your interests and what you hope to achieve from a one-on-one meeting to [taccster@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:taccster@tacc.utexas.edu). Requests must be submitted by September 22, 2023. Meeting slots are limited and we cannot guarantee that a member of the TACC staff will be available.
