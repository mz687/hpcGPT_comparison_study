# Certification Prep Checklist

## This guide defines one path for 8-12 Cert Test preparation.

Computer literacy (experience with applications, networks, and the Internet) is recommended before starting these steps. If you have programming experience, you will likely choose to do a subset of these steps, until you are comfortable programming in Java, Javascript or Python.

### Learn Block-Based Programming

If you don't have exposure to programming, complete [Code.org's Accelerated Into To CS](https://studio.code.org/s/20-hour) class to learn basic programming concepts using a simple, block-based programming language. This course is free, self-paced and interactive. This course takes approximately 20 hours to complete.

### Learn Text-Based Programming

If you don't have extensive experience with a text-based programming language like Java, complete [Codecademy's Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) course. The content of this course is free, but it is recommended that you purchase 1-2 months ($19.99 per month) of to PRO version to access practice questions and quizzes.
