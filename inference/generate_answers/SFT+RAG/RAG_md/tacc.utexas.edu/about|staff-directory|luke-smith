Dr. Luke Smith is a computational scientist and data analyst. Prior to joining TACC in 2024, Luke obtained his PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, and completed a postdoctoral appointment at the University of California, Los Angeles. Throughout this time, his research centered around the field of fluid mechanics, with a focus on the unsteady, vortex-dominated environments found on the wings of a bird or the fins of a fish. More recently, Luke has engaged in a broad effort to bring concepts from data science to the analysis of fluid flows, and his current work is aimed at developing a common framework for the analysis of large, scientific datasets. An avid technical writer, his work has appeared in such publications as the Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Physical Review Fluids, and Journal of Aviation.
