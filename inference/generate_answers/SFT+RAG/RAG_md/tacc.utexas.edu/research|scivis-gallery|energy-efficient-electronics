# Energy-efficient Electronics

### Science Behind the Image

There has been a constant effort in the semiconductor industry to strive for energy-efficient electronic devices at ultra-scaled dimensions. This image demonstrates electronic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures of novel atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) and molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), capable of such ultra-low-power operation. The possibility of realizing two separate device concepts using the same heterostructure device platform adds an element of uniqueness to this project.

### Visualization Behind the Image

Image was created using Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop based on an orthogonal front-view paper sketch by the researchers. Initially every component was in block form, followed by atomic structures in lieu of the original blocks.
