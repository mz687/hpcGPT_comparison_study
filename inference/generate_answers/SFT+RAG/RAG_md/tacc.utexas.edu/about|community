# Community @ TACC

## As an educationally-based supercomputing center, it is our responsibility to create a representative workforce so we are best prepared to research tomorrow’s needs.

To build and expand upon ideas in ways we cannot currently imagine, high performance computing and related fields must reflect the demographics of our community. There has never been a more exciting time to be in advanced computing, and TACC is working to cultivate a workforce prepared to address the spectrum of thought that tomorrow’s discoveries require.
