### TACC Dress Policy

Participants have the right to dress as they choose as long as their dress meets the approved dress and grooming regulations, does not disrupt activities, is not obscene or defamatory, and does not endanger the physical health or safety of themselves or others.

Participants have the responsibility to dress and groom in such a manner so as to reflect cleanliness, modesty, safety and good taste; become familiar with and adhere to approved dress and grooming expectations of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).

TACC's summer participant dress code standards are designed to promote an appropriate environment for individuals who are preparing themselves for life. We ask that students not wear the following:

* Any clothing that reveals undergarments including boxer shorts.
* Skirts/Shorts that are not within 1 inch of the student's fingertips when their arms are extended by their side.
* Any clothing that reveals a student's stomach, torso, chest, breasts or cleavage.
* Halter tops, tube tops, half shirts, see through blouses or backless apron garments.
* Clothing, accessories, or tattoos with references to alcohol, drugs, sex, tobacco, vulgar language, violence, gang related affiliations or other symbols that distract from the learning environment.

If a student's personal appearance or form of dress violates these standards, the student will be allowed to correct the problem. Many details and styles of clothing cannot be covered in the dress code; therefore, the administration (including counselors) of TACC reserves the right to make to final determination concerning appropriateness of a student's attire.
