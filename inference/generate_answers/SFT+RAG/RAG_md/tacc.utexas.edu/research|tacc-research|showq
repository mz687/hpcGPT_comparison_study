# Showq/Showres/qlimits

### Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide convenient tools for HPC users and administrators with easy-to-use SLURM interface or commands.

### Overview

"showq" is not a native SLURM command, but an SGE one. For users who are familiar with SGE, we created this advanced version of "showq" for SLURM users to monitor job and system status.

"showres" is a single-line command to display user and system reservation status for TACC systems. It is heavily used with the TACC Wrangler system.

"qlimits" is a single-line command to display real-time information regarding user and system limit on available queues.

### Impact

Showq is provided on all TACC systems for all users and system administrators.
