# Lasso

## Multi-touch Display

Lasso is a multi-touch display in TACC's Visualization Laboratory. At a resolution of 12.4 megapixels (5760x2160), the tiled-display consists of (6) 46" monitors in a 3x2 grid configuration and is driven by a single node using AMD Eyefinity technology. The display's most prominent feature is the PQ Labs 32-point multi-touch infrared perimeter, allowing seamless multi-touch across the display surface. Lasso is also augmented with a Microsoft Kinect for touch-less interaction.
