### TACC Training Highlights

#### [Introduction to PETSc with Victor Eijkhout](https://youtu.be/4Y8g-DcTreY)

PETSc provides a framework for the development of computational science codes. Its focus is on solving linear and nonlinear systems, but it is more than a collection of algorithms: it is a complete toolkit supporting parallel data structures, linear algebra, PDEs, meshes.

### Previous Training

JUNE 26â€“30, 2023
#### [Machine Learning Institute](https://cvent.utexas.edu/bw42mA)

At TACC ML Institute, we will walk you through the basics, state-the-of-art methods, modern tools, and hands-on exercises of machine learning and deep learning at supercomputer scale.

JUNE 12â€“16, 2023
#### [BootUp/ReBoot @ TACC Institute](https://cvent.utexas.edu/event/5552f1b0-8d11-41bf-8ee9-3bc56dab2a09/summary)

A dual boot camp focused on immersing you into the research life cycle, where you'll solve a computational scientific model, iteratively. Generate data, verify and validate the data, update the model, revisit the data... repeat until the model accurately predicts a real-life phenomenon. This is the research life cycle. Part training, part code-a-thon, part hackathon.
