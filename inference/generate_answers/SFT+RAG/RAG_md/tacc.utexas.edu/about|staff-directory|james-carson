James investigates the spatial organization of biological signals. Research includes: inventing computational approaches for mapping the spatial distribution of genes in organs; modeling the relationship between shape and function of the lung across species; and developing tools for real-time imaging and data analysis using high performance computing. James has multidisciplinary training at Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine that spans engineering, computer science, biology, and medicine. He joined TACC in 2013 after spending time at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. At TACC, James continues work to strengthen the interactions between high performance computing and life science research.
