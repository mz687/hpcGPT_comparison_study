## Algorithms & Libraries

TACC's software programs provides algorithms and standard libraries that perform calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning. TACC's programmers also create custom libraries. Most modern software systems provide libraries that implement the majority of system services. Such libraries have commoditized the services which a modern application requires. As such, most code used by modern applications is provided in these system libraries.
