John Fonner earned a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, where he used a blend of experimental and computational techniques to study binding interactions between peptides and conducting polymers for implant applications in the nervous system. He joined the Life Sciences Computing group at TACC in 2011 and has served on a number of projects that help life sciences researchers leverage advanced computing resources, both through training and through the development of better tools and cyberinfrastructure.
