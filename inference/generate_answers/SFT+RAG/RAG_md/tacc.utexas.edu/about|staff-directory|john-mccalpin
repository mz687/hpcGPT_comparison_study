John joined TACC in 2009 as a Research Scientist in the High Performance Computing Group after a twelve year career in performance analysis and system architecture in the computer industry. His industrial experience includes 3 years at SGI (performance analysis and optimization on the Origin2000 and performance lead on the architecture team for the Altix3000), 6 years at IBM (performance analysis for HPC, processor and system design for Power4/4+ and Power5/5+), and 3 years at AMD (accelerated computing technologies and performance analysis). Prior to his industrial career, John was an oceanographer (Ph.D., Florida State), spending six years as an assistant professor at the University of Delaware engaged in research and teaching on numerical simulation of the large-scale circulation of the oceans.
