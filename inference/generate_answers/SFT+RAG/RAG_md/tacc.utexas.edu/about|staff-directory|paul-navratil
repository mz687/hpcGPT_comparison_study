## **Paul Arthur Navrátil**

January 20, 1976 – October 20, 2024

Paul was a longtime TACCster, respected colleague, beloved friend, and innovative leader. Paul was the Director of Strategic Initiatives focusing on building our Edge Computing capabilities and securing several large new projects. He originally joined TACC in 2006, when still a graduate student. He was also a member of the Visualization group, an area he eventually rose to lead. TACC was critical to his personal life too--it was working here where he met his wife, former TACCster Marcia Inger. We at TACC will greatly miss Paul's enthusiasm, dedication, friendship, and booming laugh.

Paul Arthur Navrátil, 48, passed away Sunday, October 20, 2024, at his home in Austin, Texas.

Paul grew up in the Sharpstown neighborhood of Houston, where he lived until he moved to Austin to attend The University of Texas at Austin. He received a B.A. with honors in Plan II and a B.S. with honors in Computer Science and remained at UT to receive his M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science. During his time as a student, Paul was involved in numerous organizations and won several awards, including University of Texas Parents’ Association Outstanding Student, Plan II Model Thesis award, Dean’s Distinguished Graduate in Liberal Arts, and was inducted into both Phi Beta Kappa and the University of Texas Friar Society. Perhaps most special to Paul was his membership in the Tejas Club, where he continued to remain active as an alumnus, eventually serving a term as the President of the Tejas Foundation. While still a graduate student at UT, Paul joined the staff of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), where he remained throughout this career, rising to the positions of Director of Visualization and most recently the Director of Strategic Technologies. In addition to holding the position of Research Scientist at UT, Paul served as adjunct faculty in the Plan II interdisciplinary honors program, and worked independently as an intellectual property consultant.

Paul derived his greatest joy from the friendships he made throughout his life, most especially in recent years his community at Great Hills Country Club, where he was an avid if not exceptional golfer. Paul was also dedicated supporter of UT athletics as well as an avid soccer fan.

Paul is survived by his wife, Marcia Inger of Austin, Texas; sister-in-law Jolly Inger of Austin, Texas; nephews Max and Jude Fulmor; and countless loving friends.
