The WeTeach\_CS program at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) partners with educators and administrators across Texas to educate, empower, and inspire K-12 teachers and advocates to realize the vision of computer science (CS) for all.

[Renee Cosby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mreneecosby/) is the Career and Technical Education (CTE) Director for Fort Bend Independent School District. She also served as a CTE specialist for Goose Creek CISD.

We caught up with Cosby to hear about her experiences as a Black person working in CS, her perspective on the WeTeach\_CS program, and the importance of teaching CS in schools.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Why is it important to address the underrepresentation of Black students in STEM classes?

**Renee Cosby:** Addressing underrepresentation is crucial for meeting future workforce demands. Broadening participation in STEM can create social change, address economic disparities, and narrow achievement gaps while also providing role models. Through conversations with Black CS teachers in our district, I’ve found that most became teachers to address the underrepresentation problem. Programs like WeTeach\_CS are essential for broadening participation in STEM education.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** How did you first learn about the WeTeach\_CS program?

**Renee Cosby:** I was introduced to WeTeach\_CS through our partnership with Microsoft TEALS, which is active on several of our campuses. Microsoft organized a meeting with district partners to introduce Fort Bend ISD to other programs aimed at expanding our participation in CS education.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What advice would you give a Black teacher new to teaching computer science/STEM?

**Renee Cosby:** It’s crucial that Black teachers continually engage in professional development and expand their teacher capacity. One way is to build a teacher support network that keeps you encouraged and offers a safe space for collaboration and idea exchange. Also, foster a positive culture in your classroom where students feel welcomed, valued, and there is an emphasis on the real-world applications of computer science concepts.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Why should Black teachers consider WeTeach\_CS as a program and philosophy?

**Renee Cosby:** WeTeach\_CS is an excellent program committed to broadening participation in computer science by promoting diversity and inclusion in CS education. Black teachers should consider WeTeach\_CS because of the comprehensive resources, training, and educational support. WeTeach\_CS also provides access to industry partnerships and collaborations with technology leaders like Google. These elements help teachers bring real-world relevance to curriculum, exposing students to practical applications and unique learning opportunities.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Ms. Cosby.

WeTeach\_CS is part of The University of Texas at Austin’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) group within TACC, which works to advance CS education for all in Texas and beyond.

Are you an educator thinking about earning a CS teaching certification? The WeTeach\_CS [Certification Incentive Program](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/) provides a $1,000 stipend to any Texas educator who earns their certification. This stipend represents a small “thank you” to the educators bringing CS to a diverse range of students.

Explore the state of CS education at your school and in your district with the [Texas CS Education Data Dashboard](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/data-dashboard/) from the EPIC research team. The dashboard offers an interactive look at CS enrollment rates, access equity, and more.

The [Computing Educator Diversity Initiative](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/cedi-app-2024/) (CEDI), a National Science Foundation-funded Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP), recruits educators who can serve as role models for historically underrepresented student populations to become certified high school computer science teachers.
