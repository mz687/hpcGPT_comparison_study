# Updraft in a Hypothetical Supercell Simulation

### Science Behind the Image

Streamlines follow Wind Velocity and identify a supercell's signature powerful updraft. Red shows highest magnitude values, and gold surfaces high levels of Vertical Vorticity. The grid divides the ground into 12 kilometer squares, and the sum of Ice and Mixed Cloud Water Ratio provide a translucent reference to the storm's volume roughly 17400 meters tall.
