### Travel & Participation Stipend

To broaden participation in the TACCSTER 2024 symposium from around the State of Texas, we are supporting up to **six** Travel and Participation Awards for up to **$1,500** each. The awards are intended to cover registration, travel, and accommodation expenses incurred for attending TACCSTER 2024 in Austin. Award recipients will be expected to give a 15-20 minute talk on their TACC-related work in a dedicated session at the symposium.

**Eligibility**  

The Travel & Participation Awards are available to Undergraduate and Graduate Students who will be enrolled in institutions of higher education in the State of Texas at the time of the symposium. Priority will be given to those who would not otherwise be able to attend without receiving the Travel & Participation Award.

**To apply, please complete the Google form linked below, which requests:**

1. Your name, year/level of study (e.g. "3rd year graduate student"), and university/department affiliation
2. A single PDF including:
   * A short abstract (max 300 words) containing a title, names and affiliations of all authors and coauthors, and description of the work you would like to present
   * A short personal statement (max 300 words) describing how it will be helpful to your future career goals to attend and present at TACCSTER

Please provide the abstract and personal statement in a single PDF file. All materials will be de-identified, then reviewed by a panel of scientists, scholars, and educators. The application deadline is **August 9th, 2024 by 5:00pm Central Time**.

### Poster Presentations & Lightning Talks

TACCSTER is accepting abstracts to be considered for a poster presentation at the symposium. Abstracts should highlight original research or related activities performed on TACC systems (any field of study).

**To be considered for a poster presentation, please complete the Google form linked below, which requests:**

* Your name and university/department affiliation
* Co-author names and affiliations
* A short abstract (300 words max) describing the work in a single PDF

Abstracts must be submitted by **August 9, 2024**. Presenters will be notified of acceptance by August 26, 2024.

Abstracts submitted for poster presentation will be assessed on their overall content, impact, and relevance to TACC. Limited exceptional submissions will be invited to give a lightning talk in addition to a poster. Lightning talks will be no longer than five minutes (slides must be e-mailed to taccster@tacc.utexas.edu by September 20, 2024). Poster presenters will be evaluated by a panel of judges on their overall content, impact, relevance to TACC, and the effectiveness of their communication. Select presentations will be highlighted on the TACC website following the symposium.
