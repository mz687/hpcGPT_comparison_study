## Research Associate HPC Performance & Architectures

Email: **[hchen@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:hchen@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Hanning Chen joined TACC's High Performance Computing (HPC) group in 2022. His research interests include development of ab initio theory, implementation of quantum algorithm, and optimization of large-scale molecular simulation software. His research projects have secured financial support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Department of Defense (DOE), and Honda Research Institute (HRI). Prior to TACC, he taught chemistry at George Washington University and American University. Hanning is an expert of molecular modeling packages such as CP2K, NWCHEM and GROMACS, and has recently become interested in developing molecular machine learning applications based on TensorFlow, PyTorch and Graphormer.
