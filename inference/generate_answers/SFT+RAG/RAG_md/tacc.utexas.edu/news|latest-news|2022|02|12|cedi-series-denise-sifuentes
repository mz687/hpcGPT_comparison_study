The 2020-2021 Computing Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) consisted of in-service teachers of color working together as they deepened their computer science content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and equitable strategies â€” as well as be supported in their efforts to obtain their computer science (CS) teacher certification.

This is the second Q&A profile in the Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) series on teachers' experiences with the CEDI program. Denise Sifuentes currently teaches robotics at Col. John O. Ensor Middle School in Horizon City, Texas, outside of El Paso, Texas.

We caught up with Sifuentes to hear about her excitement for the future of CS in her district (Socorro ISD), her time in the CEDI program, lessons learned from the educators in her cohort, and whether she'd recommend that other teachers join the program.

**EPIC/TACC:** What piqued your interest in CS and STEM? How did you decide to pursue this field as a career?

**Denise Sifuentes:** I joined the Army after teaching physical education from 2005 to 2016 at Col. John O. Ensor Middle School. Based on my admission test scores, I qualified for a network communications track. So, I received a little bit of CS schooling in the Army, and I got to know the equipment before I was assigned to a unit. After I left the Army, I interviewed for an open robotics position at my old school, and they hired me the next day. Robotics is difficult to learn virtually because it's hands-on, and it felt like I was at a deficit, not serving my students well. I got an email about the CEDI program, and I knew it would be a great opportunity to help my students and myself.

**EPIC/TACC:** Do you have a main takeaway from your time in the initiative?

**Denise Sifuentes:** Two things stood out. First, they brought in other facilitators who were already teaching CS, which helped me learn the content and gain the confidence to teach it to my students. Second, the teachers in our cohort trusted each other enough to have difficult conversations. I trusted my CEDI community enough to ask questions about racial demographics among CS students. Before CEDI, I didn't know that my Black CS students were at a disadvantage because of the color of their skin. Thanks to my time with our cohort, I'm even more conscious about making sure my Black students feel welcomed and accepted in class. I started a Girls Who Code club because of those difficult conversations concerning a lack of access to CS for some students.

**EPIC/TACC:** Why should other teachers sign up for the CEDI program?

**Denise Sifuentes:** It will benefit both you and your students. In the beginning, I thought to myself, "What if you fail at CEDI? You're not very good at coding." However, I realized I needed to tackle the program. I would have never met these wonderful teachers if I was too afraid to try. The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure. Coding is hard, but it's not impossible. There is a fear of not being good enough, but you must overcome it. CEDI made me a better teacher and a better person.

**EPIC/TACC:** What do you hope to see for current and future CS students?

**Denise Sifuentes:** I want to get certified and teach coding to my middle-schoolers. If we want these kids to find the love for CS, we must expose them to it at an early age. I truly believe that early exposure is the key. You don't want them to think CS is too hard and decide not to try it.

**EPIC/TACC:** How has CEDI empowered you to advocate for students of color?

**Denise Sifuentes:** I emphasize to my students that they can succeed in whatever they try. Students are perceptive, and they appreciate when you show that you care. As I was leaving school the other day, a student said to me, "Hey, miss? I love you!" And I said, "Love you, too, bro!" I appreciate these gestures of appreciation from the kids, because it lets me know that coming back to teaching was the right choice.

My Army drill sergeant was a Black woman, and she was amazing. Without her, there is no way I would have made it through basic training. Her inspiration is why I always tell my students they can succeed in CS. That's why I've become more intentional in my teaching, making sure that my students are learning and retaining the CS lessons. CEDI changed the way I teach. I didn't realize that how I was addressing some students may have been putting them at a disadvantage.

**EPIC/TACC:** How has participation in CEDI empowered you to advocate for CS, particularly with students of color, in your school or district?

**Denise Sifuentes:** If I didn't go through CEDI, I wouldn't have met with my principal to suggest we offer coding classes. During the meeting, I told him, "Be ready, sir, because you'll need to update our course catalog once I'm certified to teach coding!" He's on board because he wants to offer our community another opportunity to learn CS.

**EPIC/TACC:** How was the program enhanced by the unique cohort of educators who experienced CEDI with you?

**Denise Sifuentes:** I believe that bringing together people who have different perspectives and experiences creates the best learning environment. Some of the teachers in our cohort were from inner-city Houston. One of the teachers told us that there's an adult club that students walk past on their way to school, and they all know what it is. Through CEDI, I gained insights from teachers who work in these environments. My cohort gave me good recommendations on how to help these students know that they're safe.

**EPIC/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Ms. Sifuentes.
