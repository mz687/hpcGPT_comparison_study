Since its inception in 2015, TACC's signature [Code@TACC camps](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/k-12-students/) have served more than 450 students with the majority from African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx backgrounds. Of the 140 students who attended a Code@TACC camp between 2015-2019, more than 65 percent are now pursuing postsecondary education in STEM fields.

One of these students is [Jayla House](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayla-house-23218b168/), who participated in a Code@TACC Cybersecurity camp in 2018. House was so impacted during her time as a Code@TACC camper that she returned as a counselor in 2020 and 2021. After her camp experience, House realized she wanted a career in cybersecurity.

"Code@TACC Cybersecurity opened my eyes to career options I never knew about," House said. "I was a self-taught programmer with a passion for coding but was unsure of what career choices I could have besides developing video games. During Code@TACC, I learned to use code in ways I'd never considered, like using it to defend against current cyber threats and being aware of threats in the evolving digital age. These were the things that really stuck with me."

In May 2022, House graduated from Texas State University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This summer, she will relocate to Mooresville, North Carolina, to join Booz Allen Hamilton as a Cybersecurity Consultant. In her new role, she will assess their network and software for vulnerabilities and create security solutions.

"After my experiences with Code@TACC, I felt like I had more of a purpose and responsibility to use my CS skills and education to help solve real-world problems," she said.

Edgar Garza is a senior training coordinator with TACC's Education & Outreach team. Garza designs curriculum for the summer programs and serves as the lead educator for the robotics and cybersecurity camps. Seeing students succeed motivates him in his work.

"Jayla's passion for CS and cybersecurity is a testament to how a program like ours can inspire and motivate students who may not have had the opportunity elsewhere," Garza said. "I met Jayla in 2020 during our virtual Code@TACC Cybersecurity CompTIA certification workshop, where she was extremely helpful and willing to learn. In 2021, she was a counselor at all three of our summer camps and was a great benefit to the students."

TACC Education and Outreach staff make a concerted effort to visit high schools, local businesses, and churches to promote Code@TACC camps. Staff members recruit students who are new to coding and camp experiences, or who may not know how to access or navigate higher education. Forty-five percent of Code@TACC participants have been girls, and 44 percent have been first-generation college aspirants (children of parents who do not hold college degrees).

For Garza, seeing House's success gives him a sense of pride.

"Jayla and all of the students who have participated in Code@TACC camps — and those who have not been able to participate — inspire me to continue working to provide students with opportunities to become curious about CS," Garza said.

House attributes her drive and success to her mother.

"My mother, Laura, retired as a Major after serving for 23 years in the Army. While serving in the military, she received a master's degree in criminal justice from the American Military University in 2012," House said. "In 2019, when I graduated from Central Texas College with an associate degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, she was graduating from Texas A&M University Central Texas with her second master's degree — this one in Education. During my time at Booz Allen Hamilton, I plan to pursue a PhD, which my mother inspired me to do."
