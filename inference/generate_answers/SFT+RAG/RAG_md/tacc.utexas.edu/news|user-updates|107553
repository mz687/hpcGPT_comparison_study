The service which provides MFA tokens via SMS is experiencing nationwide issues. This is preventing some users from logging in if they are unable to receive the message in a timely manner.    
Unfortunately, there is not ETA for when this service will be restored to full functionality.  
If you are having problems logging in due to delayed SMS messages, you may switch to an MFA token app such as Duo or Google Auth. We provide instructions for setting up your MFA here: <https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/>
