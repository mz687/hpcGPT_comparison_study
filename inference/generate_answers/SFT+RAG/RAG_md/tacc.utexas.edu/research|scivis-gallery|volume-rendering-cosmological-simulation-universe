# Volume Rendering of a Cosmological Simulation of the Universe

### Science Behind the Image

This is an image from a cosmological simulation of the Universe performed by the Enzo multi-physics hydrodynamics code. Enzo is used to study the physical processes present in the evolution of the cosmos.

### Visualization Behind the Image

The visualization was performed using a modified version of the yt open source data analysis and visualization package. The yt-project grew out of the Enzo community to satisfy a need to visualize and analyze the large data resulting from the Enzo simulations. Collaborators at TACC and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) modified the yt framework to utilize a ray tracing back end called GraviT to perform volume rendering of the adaptive mesh refinement data. This image shows a volume rendering of density in which the color and opacity are mapped to the density distribution.
