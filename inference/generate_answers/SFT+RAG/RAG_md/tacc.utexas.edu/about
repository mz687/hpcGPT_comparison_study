## Powering Discoveries That Change The World

Every day, researchers rely on our computing experts and resources to help them gain insights and make discoveries that change the world.

**Our Mission: Enable discoveries that advance science and society through the application of advanced computing technologies.**

Where should we store vaccines in case of an epidemic outbreak? What is the likelihood of a hurricane forming? How do we create more viable, cost efficient energy sources? TACC designs and deploys the world's most powerful advanced computing technologies and innovative software solutions to enable researchers to answer complex questions like these and many more.

### Our Culture

TACC strives to be an innovator in all aspects of technology. It is important to us that this technology serves not only researchers but also the community. TACC fosters a culture of innovation, passion, and fun. TACC staff members actively collaborate to investigate the latest technologies, team up for charities, and celebrate successes together — both during and after work. From building Stampede to running a 5K, we are a team first and foremost.

### Our Community

Austin is known for live music, festivals, beautiful parks, and barbecue. It is home to The University of Texas at Austin and major technology companies like Dell, IBM, Apple, Google, Samsung, and National Instruments. We think Austin is tops, but don’t just take our word for it — *Forbes*, *Businessweek*, and *Time* have all named Austin one of the best places in the country to live.
