The Education & Outreach (E&O) programs at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) inspire students to reach their full potential. E&O has intentionally developed strategic programming aimed at broadening participation in computing.

[Dr. Maureen Kitheka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maureenkitheka2020/) was a member of TACC’s 2020-2021 [Frontera Computational Science Fellowship](https://frontera-portal.tacc.utexas.edu/fellowship/) cohort. Kitheka is a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. She earned her PhD from Binghamton University in 2023 and her bachelor’s from the University of Nairobi in 2016.

We caught up with Kitheka to hear about her experience as a Black person in STEM, her takeaways from TACC’s Frontera Fellowship program, and the importance of teaching STEM to the next generation.

**E&O/TACC:** What inspired you to work in STEM? Was it a dearth of Black teachers in classrooms?

**Maureen Kitheka:** As a child, I had a deep desire to understand how the world around me works, and what better way to do that than through chemistry? My high school chemistry teacher recognized my potential and nurtured it. Being a woman in STEM herself, she helped foster my love for the subject and encouraged me to believe that I, too, could be successful in STEM as a Black woman. I firmly believe that STEM has a crucial role in tackling important global challenges. I’m motivated to make a significant impact in fields such as catalysis and renewable energy.

**E&O/TACC:** How did you first learn about TACC’s Frontera Fellowship program?

**Maureen Kitheka:** I had been using [Stampede2](//tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2/) for one of my research projects when I received an email from Dan Stanzione, TACC’s Executive Director, about the fellowship. I decided to apply after learning more about the opportunity. After being part of such an amazing experience, I encourage my fellow graduate students to apply so they can have a chance to use [Frontera](//tacc.utexas.edu/systems/frontera/), one of the fastest academic supercomputers in the world.

**E&O/TACC:** What are some key lessons you learned during your time as a Frontera Fellow?

**Maureen Kitheka:** Programming skills are indispensable in computational chemistry. Receiving hands-on training in C++ enabled me to gain proficiency in Python, which opened numerous career opportunities. Working with talented peers and TACC personnel expanded my professional network and broadened my perspectives on teamwork. The collaborative environment of the Fellowship helped me build lasting connections and grow and develop significantly. I’m grateful for the valuable experiences and opportunities it provided. On a personal level, I want to send a very special thank you to Education & Outreach Director [Rosalia Gomez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosalia-gomez-368035198/) for your support and staying in touch!

**E&O/TACC:** What advice would you give a Black person interested in teaching or studying STEM?

**Maureen Kitheka:** As someone in STEM from an underrepresented background, I understand the challenges one can face in this field. My advice is to seize any opportunity that comes your way, be open to learning and developing skills beyond academics, build a supportive network, and inspire others who may not see themselves represented in the field. To quote Michelle Obama, “Do not be afraid. Be focused. Be determined. Be hopeful. Be empowered.”

**E&O/TACC:** Why should Black STEM professionals partner with Education & Outreach programs?

**Maureen Kitheka:** Education & Outreach programs fosters a sense of belonging within the STEM community. During my time in graduate school, I was involved in a Chemistry outreach program where we visited schools to educate historically underrepresented students about STEM and the opportunities available to them. As a Black person myself, my presence helped motivate students from similar backgrounds to continue pursuing their education despite the challenges they may face. This, in turn, inspired the next generation of aspiring STEM enthusiasts. To everyone at TACC and my fellow Fellows, thank you for making my experience a memorable one!

**E&O/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to STEM, Dr. Kitheka.
