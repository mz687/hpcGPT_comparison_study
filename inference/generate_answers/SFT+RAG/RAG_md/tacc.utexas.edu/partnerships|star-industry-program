### Benefits

STAR membership provides access to TACC’s systems, as well as the center’s expertise, software and tools, and publications and reports. Additionally, members may choose to work with well-trained undergraduate and graduate students, who can go on to internships and even employment at your organization.

Individuals and organizations inexperienced in advanced computing can work with TACC to develop the knowledge and skills required for active, constructive participation.

Technology companies benefit from collaborating with TACC to develop and evaluate prototypes of hardware & software, leveraging TACC's systems and expertise for better exploration of users' needs.

### Annual STAR Workshop

Participation in the annual STAR Member Workshop in the fall, which promotes information sharing and knowledge transfer between TACC and STAR affiliates, and among the affiliates themselves.

### Quarterly Working Sessions

TACC staff and STAR partner representatives will share information on recent challenges, solutions, and lessons learned on a variety of topics.

### Monthly Training Sessions

Classes allow members to upgrade and develop new skills in high-end computing, scientific visualization and data analysis, code optimization, and distributed and collaborative computing.

### Expanded Benefits

TACC works with STAR members to tailor the program to their unique needs and goals. Small firms and start-ups may be invited to join at a reduced rate. For sponsored research projects, additional fees are determined by the combination of optional components negotiated by the participant, on a case-by-case basis. Membership fees are charged for annual participation in the program, based on date of entry, and may be adjusted as TACC upgrades its systems and software.
