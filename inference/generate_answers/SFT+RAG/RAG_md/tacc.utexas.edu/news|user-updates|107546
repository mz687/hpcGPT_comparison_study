**Want to Participate?**To be eligible to participate in Texascale Days September 2024, your large scale workflow must have already **successfully run on at least 2,048 nodes** in the "large" queue on Frontera.  
For access to the Frontera "large" queue, please [submit a ticket](https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/tickets) with scaling data.  
To request to participate, please fill out and submit the application below by **17:00 CDT September 10th.**On **Wednesday, September 18th**, two hour blocks will be available for large-scale benchmarking efforts.
