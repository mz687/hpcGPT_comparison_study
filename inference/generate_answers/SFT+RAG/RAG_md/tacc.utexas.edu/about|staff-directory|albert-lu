## Research Associate HPC Applications

Email: **[alu@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:alu@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Albert joined TACC in Spring 2018 as a Research Associate in the HPC Application group.

Albert's current research interest has focused on the development of new tools for resource monitoring on HPC systems and the creation of graphical user interfaces/platforms for data collection, management, and visualization. Additionally, he is actively involved in writing software packages that utilize the moving boundary truncated grid method to model dynamical systems.

Albert obtained his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Austin, where his research was centered on developing novel methodologies to extend the timescales of molecular dynamics simulations. Following his graduation, he served as a postdoctoral researcher in the Theoretical Division at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (2011-2014) and later at the Department of Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University (2014-2016). Before joining TACC, he worked as a computational materials scientist at Brewer Science Inc.
