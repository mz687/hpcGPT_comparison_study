James (Jimmy) Newland is a Computer Science Education Specialist for EPIC (Expanding Pathways in Computing) at UT Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), where he helps educators learn computer science concepts and pedagogy so they can become certified computer science teachers.

Jimmy taught physics, astronomy, computer science, and web design for 28 years at Bellaire High School in Houston. He has also taught web design and web application programming as an adjunct in the Department of Information Science at the University of North Texas. He has a B.S. in physics and astronomy from Mississippi State University and an M.Ed. and Ph.D. in science education from the University of Houston. Jimmy is interested in investigating the integration of computer science and computational thinking into non-computing courses and the impacts of participation in authentic computing research projects on students and teachers. Jimmy is also interested in making computing equitable and open to all through research, education, and advocacy.
