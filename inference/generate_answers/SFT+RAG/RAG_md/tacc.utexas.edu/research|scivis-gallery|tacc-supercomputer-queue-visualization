# TACC SuperComputer Queue Visualization

### Science Behind the Image

SupercomputingQueueVis is a Processing sketch based off of Paul Bourke's HPC queue statistics visualization. It converts the CommnQ server output into pairs of spheres and cylinders arranged in a helical pattern that represents the status of the supercomputer's queue.

### Visualization Behind the Image

Our goal was to develop a visualization that could give systems administrators and users a complete understanding of the queue's state with nothing more than a quick glance. In our implementation, · Each job is represented by a cluster of same-colored, consecutive spheres · Each sphere is a node · Sphere size is proportional to the number of nodes per job · Each cylinder represents allocated time · Color along cylinder represents time used now using Hanlon's API to access Stampede queue data in realtime.
