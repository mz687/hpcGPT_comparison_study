The WeTeach\_CS program at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) partners with educators and administrators across Texas to educate, empower, and inspire K-12 teachers, and advocates to realize the vision of computer science (CS) for all.

[Steward Bailey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steward-bailey-b30979283/) leads the Aerospace Engineering program at Elisik High School in Alief ISD. He is certified to teach Technology courses to Grade 8-12 students and is working on obtaining his CS teaching certification with the help of WeTeach\_CS.

We caught up with Bailey to hear about his experiences as a Black person working in CS, his perspective on the WeTeach\_CS program, and the importance of teaching CS in schools.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What inspired you to work in computer science education? Was it a dearth of Black teachers in CS classrooms?

**Steward Bailey:** While teaching middle school computer science, I noticed a lack of African American CS students and instructors. I was motivated to recruit students who looked like me so they could be taught by someone who looks like them. I now teach more diverse populations, fostering a welcoming environment, and using CS concepts in aerial robotics that require programming drone motors and sensors.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** How did you first learn about the WeTeach\_CS program?

**Steward Bailey:** I learned about WeTeach\_CS from a friend and coworker who was passionate about bringing more minority students and instructors into CS courses. Signing up for We-Teach\_CS professional development training felt like the best way to prepare for the certification test while also alerting other instructors to inequalities and gaps within the CS K-12 communities.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What advice would you give a Black teacher new to teaching computer science/STEM?

**Steward Bailey:** Initially, the subject will feel foreign to most students and instructors. Build a supportive community and stay as immersed as possible, and you will see the benefits of teaching CS to your students. Partnering with the WeTeach\_CS program prepared me to teach difficult concepts and identify potential student difficulties with CS subject matter.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Why should Black teachers consider WeTeach\_CS as a program and philosophy?

**Steward Bailey:** The community of Black CS educators in Texas is a small population. By increasing the number of educators, we can recruit more students of color. This investment can directly contribute to increasing minority representation in the technology industry. WeTeach\_CS training is very assistive in teaching skills and strategies to up-and-coming CS instructors.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Mr. Bailey.

WeTeach\_CS is part of The University of Texas at Austin’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) group within TACC, which works to advance CS education for all in Texas and beyond.

Are you an educator thinking about earning a CS teaching certification? The WeTeach\_CS [Certification Incentive Program](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/) provides a $1,000 stipend to any Texas educator who earns their certification. This stipend represents a small “thank you” to the educators bringing CS to a diverse range of students.

Explore the state of CS education at your school and in your district with the [Texas CS Education Data Dashboard](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/data-dashboard/) from the EPIC research team. The dashboard offers an interactive look at CS enrollment rates, access equity, and more.

The [Computing Educator Diversity Initiative](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/cedi-app-2024/) (CEDI), a National Science Foundation-funded Research Practitioner Partnership (RPP), recruits educators who can serve as role models for historically underrepresented student populations to become certified high school computer science teachers.
