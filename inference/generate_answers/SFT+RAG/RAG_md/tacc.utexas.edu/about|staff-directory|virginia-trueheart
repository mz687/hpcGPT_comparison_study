Virginia joined TACC in 2015 as a member of the HPC Support staff. She spent five years translating her corporate customer support training into HPC specific skills and expanding the support operations of the HPC group. In 2020, she became the manager of the new HPC Frontline Support group. She led this team of four in expanding the support operations at TACC and improving communications between HPC, LSS, and researchers. This group also bolstered the training and research efforts of the HPC group, allowing TACC to provide more hands on training and tailored support for researchers.

In 2023, Virginia became the Director of the User Services group. Merging the HPC Frontline Support group with the existing User Services team, she strives to provide a comprehensive Services experience to all researchers on TACC systems. She strives to improve the research experience at TACC and increase the operational efficiency of support and training services.
