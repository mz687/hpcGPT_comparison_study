Adriana Reyes does not seek the spotlight. From her service in the Texas Army National Guard to her time as a Code@TACC leader, [Reyes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriana-monica-reyes/) believes in the power of inspiring the next generation and equipping them with tools for success in the classroom and beyond.

In May, Reyes earned her bachelor’s degree in computer science from The University of Texas at Austin and, in September, relocated to Seattle to start her career as a software engineer at Salesforce. In her new role, Reyes will work on scalability of core systems and updating legacy code.

“Because of my internships in high school, I wasn’t able to attend a residential Code@TACC camp, but I always wanted the experience,” Reyes said. “Working as a summer camp counselor was a full-circle moment.” Camp counselors provide direction to program participants with support and guidance on their projects and activities.

“Adriana was able to show campers they can have successful careers in STEM because of her real-world coding experiences,” Hunter said. “I have always appreciated her drive and commitment to her goals since meeting her when she was a freshman in high school.” Hunter met Reyes during a 2017 STEM student recruitment event at Akins High School in Austin.

TACC’s E&O group visits local high schools, businesses, and churches — to name a few outreach avenues — to promote Code@TACC camps. The staff recruits students who are new to coding and camp experiences, or who may not know how to access or navigate higher education.

Code@TACC head counselor [Yaritza Kenyon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaritza-kenyon-35a25b1ab/) fondly remembers her time alongside Reyes during the 2024 summer camps.

“Adriana’s enthusiasm and dedication to the campers was amazing,” Kenyon said. “One moment that stood out was when she took the time to answer every camper’s question about studying computer science at UT Austin. Adriana’s insights and experiences helped campers understand what it's like to pursue a degree in STEM.”

Reyes attributes her spirit of commitment and her inspiration to serve in the National Guard to her mother, Hilda Reyes.

“My mother was a first-generation college student who graduated from Texas State before spending 20 years in the United States Navy Reserve. Seeing that example of perseverance has stuck with me,” Adriana Reyes said.

Said Hilda Reyes: “Adriana’s selflessness and dedication to service inspires me. I’m proud of her academic and professional accomplishments, but I’m even more proud of her high character.”

Since its inception in 2015, TACC’s signature camps have served more than 600 students, the majority women and students who historically have been underrepresented in STEM. Hundreds of these campers have gone on to pursue postsecondary education in STEM fields.

“Students should check out E&O programs because they provide a hands-on, immersive experience in various STEM activities, offering insights and skills not typically offered in a school setting,” Reyes said. “I’m grateful to TACC for enriching my life and fostering a vibrant, dynamic learning environment for students who might not otherwise be exposed to STEM.”

Reyes’ success aligns perfectly with TACC’s E&O mission.

“TACC engages K-12 students in STEM exploration activities that introduce them to how computing impacts society,” Hunter said. “E&O works with students to show them there’s a place for them in STEM. We couldn’t be more excited for Adriana!”
