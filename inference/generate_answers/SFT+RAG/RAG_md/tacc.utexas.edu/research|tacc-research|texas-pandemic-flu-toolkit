# Texas Pandemic Flu Toolkit

### Purpose

The Texas Pandemic Flu Toolkit is a collection of tools for forecasting and simulating flu pandemics, as well as optimizing health resources across the state. These tools are made available via a web-based interface, where users can compute new models and interactively visualize results using a variety of methods. These tools are used by DSHS in preparation for future pandemics, and in response for actual pandemics when they occur. The project leveraged tools from a previous collaboration during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
