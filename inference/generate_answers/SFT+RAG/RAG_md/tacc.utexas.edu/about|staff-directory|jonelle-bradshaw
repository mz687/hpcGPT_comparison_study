## Research Associate Scientific and Technological Innovations

Email: **[jbradshaw@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:jbradshaw@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez will join the Texas Advanced Computing Center as a Research Associate on September 1, 2024. Her research agenda focuses on scientific and technological innovations and its impact on society. Her studies explore the impacts of technological advances such as artificial intelligence and large language models in interdisciplinary fields. This includes workforce development, health, cyber-resiliency, economics and philanthropy. The unifying theme in her portfolio is understanding scalable impacts of technology in various fields that improve the human condition. At TACC she will research the impacts of supercomputing and understand the outcomes of the societal investments in these fields. The role of computational strength in many fields is unprecedented. Understanding the scalability opportunities of this innovation will help scientists who are utilizing supercomputing to further expand impactful research across disciplines.

Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez was recruited to UT Austin from New York as the Executive Director of Foundation Relations in Texas Development. Her roles in fundraising across three universities was spurred by her faculty colleagues stating that the failure to addressing many of our social ills was due to the lack of funding to pursue important research agendas. Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez is an applied scientist and decided to simultaneously work on her scholarly portfolio while implementing funding strategies as a force multiplier to address this deficit. As a result, her doctoral work was an important part of her successful funding career and led to her status as a recognized national leader in philanthropy. While at Texas she managed a $1.8 billion dollar portfolio and led her team to increase production 6x growth over 4 years leading the university to move from #11 foundation program to #4 in the nation. She worked directly with university leadership to raise transformational gifts in the areas of semiconductors, basic science, humanities and innovative medicine. Managing her funding work while earning a Ph.D. in Engineering, Technology and Policy allowed her a unique vantage point to understand university priorities, grant makers and faculty needs. It is this distinctive experience that has led her to TACC because it has never been more important for scientists to research and demonstrate the impact of computation in an ever-changing society.

Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez pursuit of her doctorate from an engineering school is her recognition that engineers solve big problems, and she wanted to research those areas to address the implications of technology implementation and the effects it may have on society at scale, especially the most vulnerable populations. Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez believes that researching scientific and innovation applications through the lens of societal impact is a needed added prism due to the rapidity of technology and its far-reaching effects today. She speaks multiple research languages in engineering, economics, education, national security, health and philanthropy. This has enabled her to become a public interest technologist, to make connections across academic lines and to develop models that transcends fields.

Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez is the epitome of an interdisciplinary scientist. She will bring her vast experience in research, strategic planning, high performance and philanthropy to continue to support TACC’s great success as a global leader in supercomputing. She looks forward to collaborating with her brilliant faculty colleagues to improve the lives of human beings through scientific inquiry and implementation in the great state of Texas, the nation and the world. Dr. Bradshaw de Hernandez lives in Austin with her husband, son and rescue dog Mando (named after the Mandalorian). She takes advantage of the Austin live music and food scene and enjoys it with family and friends.
