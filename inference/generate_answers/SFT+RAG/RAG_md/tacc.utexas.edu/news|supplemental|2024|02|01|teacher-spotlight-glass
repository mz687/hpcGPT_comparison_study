The [WeTeach\_CS](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/) program at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) partners with educators and administrators across Texas to educate, empower, and inspire K-12 teachers and advocates to realize the vision of computer science (CS) for all.

[Shaina Glass](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaina-glass-646b9044/) is director of Education for the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and previously served as chapter president for CSTA Houston. Glass also spent 16 years in Aldine ISD working as an instructional technology specialist, CS/STEM coordinator, and Tech Apps program director.

As part of Black History Month, we caught up with Glass to hear about her experiences as a Black person working in CS, her perspective on the WeTeach\_CS program, and the importance of teaching CS in schools.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What inspired you to work in CS education? Was it a dearth of Black teachers in CS classrooms?

**Shaina Glass:** When I taught third- and fourth-graders in Aldine ISD, we established what we called a Wondering Wall, where students list topics they wonder about or questions they have. Their curiosity led to me asking why we don’t teach students how to create solutions, which led me to computing. As I advanced and supported more teachers across schools in my district, I faced challenges with diversifying CS classrooms.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** How did you first learn about the WeTeach\_CS program?

**Shaina Glass:** While attending a Texas Computer Education Association workshop, an attendee mentioned computer science and suggested that I investigate WeTeach\_CS. I was looking into how to teach CS in my classroom and came back to my district and convinced my principal to send me. There were few Black faces and even fewer female faces in CS classrooms. I worked alongside a [Microsoft TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals) district rep to create a program to support students diving into CS classes. I also connected our Black and Hispanic teachers with the [CEDI program](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/cedi-app-2024/) to help them become CS teachers for our students. I also worked alongside the teachers in establishing Girls Who Code clubs in our district across 20 campuses to activate a recruitment campaign for girls to build their confidence while learning CS.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What advice would you give a Black teacher new to teaching computer science/STEM?

**Shaina Glass:** If you feel alone and/or misunderstood, imagine how your students feel. It’s not easy teaching in a field that reflects the industry we are trying to prepare students to change. Teachers can be the solution to the problem. We can prepare the next generation of the world’s problem-solvers! I know that’s a lot of pressure on your shoulders, but you are not alone. You may be the only CS teacher on your campus, but there are many of us out here in CS education and, in this space, we lean on each other. If you are unsure where to find a network of Black CS educators, one of the places I recommend is CSTA’s Black [Affinity Group](https://csteachers.org/affinity-groups/). Connect with like-minded professionals and read professional learning content created by Black educators for Black educators.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Why should Black teachers consider WeTeach\_CS as a program and philosophy?

**Shaina Glass:** WeTeach\_CS was my first home for CS professional learning. I received a scholarship to attend a previous [WeTeach\_CS Summit](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/weteach_cs-summit-2024/) and saw that there are so many takeaways that you can implement in your classroom, school, or district. I have attended WeTeach\_CS Summits in several roles and always leave with nuggets. WeTeach\_CS provides a variety of support systems and professional learning opportunities to meet you where you are in your CS educational journey. Whether you are considering becoming a CS teacher, new to CS, or a veteran teacher, WeTeach\_CS is right for you.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Mrs. Glass.

WeTeach\_CS is part of The University of Texas at Austin’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) group within TACC, which works to advance CS education for all in Texas and beyond.

Are you an educator thinking about earning a CS teaching certification? The WeTeach\_CS [Certification Incentive Program](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/) provides a $1,000 stipend to any Texas educator who earns their certification. This stipend represents a small “thank you” to the educators bringing CS to a diverse range of students.

Explore the state of CS education at your school and in your district with the [Texas CS Education Data Dashboard](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/data-dashboard/) from the EPIC research team. The dashboard offers an interactive look at CS enrollment rates, access equity, and more.
