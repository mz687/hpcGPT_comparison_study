# Tokamak Simulation: Toroidal Plasma Currents

### Science Behind the Image

A tokamak's toroidal machine vessel is collapsed into a rectangular solid, front to back axis along the periodic. Radio frequency (RF) waves in MegaAmpere toroidal plasma currents are launched to confine solar temperature plasmas, and can be studied with visualization. Left shows the RF electric potential, right is electron density. White contours at the front define magnetic surfaces confining the core (top) and exhaust chamber (bottom) plasmas.
