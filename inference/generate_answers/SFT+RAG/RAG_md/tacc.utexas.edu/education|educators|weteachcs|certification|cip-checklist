# Certification Incentive Program (CIP) Checklist

## WeTeach\_CS is offering a $1,000 stipend to currently certified Texas educators who add a CS certification to their resume. For complete information about deadlines and requirements, please read and follow all steps of the CIP Checklist below.

#### Don't Forget Certification Prep

If you're hoping to get CS certified and collect your $1000 stipend, then give yourself your best chance for success by getting prepared before you take the CS certification exam. To help you prepare, we've created a four-step [Certification Prep Checklist](/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/prep-checklist/).

### Verify CIP Eligibility

Candidates must meet all the following conditions to be eligible for the CIP stipend:

* Be pursuing a TEA certification in Computer Science 8-12.
* Not already be certified in Computer Science or Computer Information Systems (any level).
* Be currently certified to teach in Texas and the teacher of record in a **public** or **charter** school classroom or enrolled in an approved teacher certification program for Texas.

### Decide on When to Take the Test

The TExES CS 8-12 Test is available by appointment, year-round, on a first-come, first served basis. As you gain confidence in your programming skills, decide on a testing window when you plan on taking the test.

### Understand CIP Requirements and Deadlines

* **You must complete the Certification Incentive Program (CIP) form online (link in Step 4)**
* **You need to provide all of the subsequently requested documentation (listed in Step 5) before testing.**
* After passing the CS 241 test, you will have five weeks to provide us with your updated SBEC Texas Educator Certificate.
