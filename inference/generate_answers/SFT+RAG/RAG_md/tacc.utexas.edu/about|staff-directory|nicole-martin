Nicole joined TACC in 2019. She designs, manages, and conducts evaluation for STEM education programs to assess the impact and effectiveness of various programs across K-12 and college settings. She researches computer science and science education, investigating issues around equity, instructional practices, and student and teacher outcomes. She also supports educational outreach and teacher professional learning programs in computer science. Before joining TACC, Nicole worked as a research associate at the STEM Center in the College of Education at UT Austin evaluating STEM education programs. Prior to her work at UT Austin, she received her Ph.D. in Educational Psychology from the University of Wisconsin – Madison. Her background is in the Learning Sciences, and her research has focused on middle school science teaching and learning, particularly on how teachers support students to learn science as practice.
