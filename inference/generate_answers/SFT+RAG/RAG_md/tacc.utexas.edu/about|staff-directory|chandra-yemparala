I’m Chandra. I’m originally from India. I completed my Master of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2000. I began my professional journey by developing Radio Network Controller software at Motorola. In my most recent role, I focused on creating data center systems products at Meta. Currently, my weekends are primarily dedicated to spending quality time with my daughter, engaging in activities such as playing tennis and assisting her with school-related tasks. Additionally, I have developed a passion for running, and I have successfully maintained a routine of running a 5k every day for numerous years.
