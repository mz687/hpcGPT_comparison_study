Hi, I'm Juan. I'm part of the Web and Mobile Applications group (WMA) at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). My activities include supporting and developing software for a wide array of tools and applications while utilizing good software development practices. I also participate in the design and development of applications for Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI), XSEDE User Portal and Controlled Information Compliance System (CICS), interact and collaborate with researchers to develop new features, and contribute to a technical team using various development methodologies in order to write, test, and deploy production-quality software services.
