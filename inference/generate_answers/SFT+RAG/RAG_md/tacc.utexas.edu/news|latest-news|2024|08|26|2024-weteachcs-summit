The 2024 WeTeach\_CS Summit was held in Fort Worth, Texas, marking the second straight year TACC’s [Expanding Pathways in Computing](https://tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/) (EPIC) team has taken the show on the road. Holding the event in different Texas cities gives educators who might not be able to travel the opportunity to attend the conference.

More than 400 computer science (CS) teachers, advocates, administrators, professional development providers, university instructors, and policy makers gathered for the eighth annual Summit. WeTeach\_CS is the professional development component of the EPIC program.

“One key lesson that I took from this year’s Summit is the power of belonging,” said WeTeach\_CS Director [Amy Carrell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-carrell-a594009/). “It’s great to see familiar faces attend the Summit. It’s even more special to meet teachers who have never attended a WeTeach\_CS Summit but feel an instant connection with us.”

The EPIC team is guided by a simple principle: regardless of background or socioeconomic status, every student deserves access to high-quality CS education. EPIC collaborates with school districts, institutions of higher education, industry leaders, and federal, state, and local government entities who are also dedicated to expanding access and opportunity for students [historically underserved](https://code.org/assets/advocacy/stateofcs/2023_state_of_cs.pdf) in computing.

“WeTeach\_CS is an amazing program with lots of teacher support and professional development opportunities,” said Lufkin ISD teacher Thomas Hungerford. “It’s important to teach CS education in our schools — the best way to address the shortage of quality workers in STEM careers is to give our students the skills and experience needed to enter the workforce.”

### Focus on Artificial Intelligence

Echoing UT Austin’s “[Year of AI](https://yearofai.utexas.edu/),” the WeTeach\_CS Summit featured multiple sessions on artificial intelligence in the education space. Keynote speaker [Kyle Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbamba/), Education for Social Impact Senior Program Manager at Google, addressed the following key areas: what is AI, how it is showing up in generative technology, and how CS education must shift to prepare students to create the AI tools of the future.

“AI is going to have a profound impact on the future of our students,” Ali said. “We have a great opportunity to help them learn these technologies and use them to have a positive social impact on their communities.”

### Importance of Broadening Participation in Computing

Another important topic at this year’s Summit was broadening participation in computing, with seven sessions on strategies for expanding CS education in local schools and districts. The Computing Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) consists of in-service educators working together as they deepen their CS content knowledge and pedagogical skills, while receive support to obtain their CS teacher certification.

“Like students, teachers who come from historically underrepresented backgrounds often don’t see themselves in CS spaces,” said [Allen Antoine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenantoine/), EPIC’s Director of CS education strategy. “CEDI allows educators to build community and learn about STEM education in a welcoming, safe environment.”

“The CEDI cohort exposed me to different areas of computer science like cybersecurity, networking, and game development,” said former Stafford Middle School teacher [Emmanuel Byas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emanuel-byas-aa07a3198/). “Attending the WeTeach\_CS Summit has broadened my perspective to the opportunities that are out there. Previously, I thought computer science was just coding.”

### Meet the Award Winners

WeTeach\_CS leadership presented Change Maker and Mini-Grant awards to nine outstanding educators for their contributions to improving CS education in Texas.

Established in 2016, these annual awards are given to dedicated CS teachers and administrators who bring innovative strategies to their classrooms and serve as leaders for expanded CS opportunities in their schools and districts:

#### 2024 WeTeach\_CS Change Maker Administrator Award Winner

* Frank Clark, Canutillo ISD

#### 2024 WeTeach\_CS Change Maker Teacher Award Winners

* Kimberly Lee, Plainview ISD
* Cristina Jiminez, Donna ISD

#### 2024 WeTeach\_CS Mini-Grant Award Winners

* Andres Chavez, Fort Bend ISD
* Daniel Wennersten, Grapevine-Colleyville ISD
* Denise Miles, Smithville ISD
* Heather Solis, Georgetown ISD
* Kay Orr and Leslie Reese, Rockwall ISD
* Sierra Dixon, Doral Academy Preparatory

“Winning a Change Maker Award validated all the hard work that goes into teaching computer science,” said Kimberly Lee of Plainview ISD. “I will use the award money to purchase STEM kits and other items that will make CS education accessible to more students.”

The awards were sponsored by VEX Robotics and the College Board Career Kickstart Program.

“VEX Robotics is honored to partner with WeTeach\_CS in recognizing and rewarding teachers and administrators who are making a real impact in CS education,” said President and CEO Tony Norman. “Learning computer science at an early age is important to developing students’ problem-solving and computational thinking skills. Through initiatives like the Change Maker and Mini Grant awards, VEX Robotics aims to support and inspire educators who are dedicated to fostering these essential skills in their students.”

“Career Kickstart, a new career-focused program powered by Advanced Placement, is honored to partner with WeTeach\_CS in recognizing and rewarding teachers who are making a real impact in cybersecurity education,” said Michael Warner, College Board Career Kickstart Director for Research & Scale. “Dedicated educators can help pave the path to meaningful and sustainable careers for the students they serve.”

“It is imperative to teach computer science education in our schools because it can change the lives of our students,” said Elizabeth White of Hawkins ISD. “I am grateful to WeTeach\_CS for giving teachers such wonderful professional development opportunities.”

The 2025 WeTeach\_CS Summit will take place June 9-10 in Austin.

Explore the state of CS education at your school and in your district with the [Texas CS Education Data Dashboard](https://tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/data-dashboard/) from the EPIC research team. The dashboard offers an interactive look at CS enrollment rates, equity in access, and more.

Are you an educator thinking about earning a CS teaching certification? The WeTeach\_CS [Certification Incentive Program](https://tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/) provides a $1,000 stipend to any Texas educator who earns their certification. This stipend represents a small “thank you” to the educators bringing CS to a diverse range of students.

The CEDI program is funded by the National Science Foundation ([NSF #1837602](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1837602)). Learn more about their CS goals in the [CEDI Special Report](https://tacc.utexas.edu/news/latest-news/2022/04/18/changing-face-cs-education/).
