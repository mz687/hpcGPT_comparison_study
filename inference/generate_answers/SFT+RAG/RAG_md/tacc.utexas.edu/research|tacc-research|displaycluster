# DisplayCluster

### Purpose

DisplayCluster is a software environment for interactively driving large-scale tiled displays. The software allows users to interactively view media such as high-resolution imagery and video, as well as stream content from remote sources such as laptops / desktops or high-performance remote visualization machines. Many users can simultaneously interact with DisplayCluster with devices such as joysticks or touch-enabled devices such as the iPhone / iPad / iTouch or Android devices. Additionally, a Python scripting interface is provided to automate interaction with DisplayCluster.

DisplayCluster currently drives Stallion, the world's highest resolution tiled display.

#### DisplayCluster Features

* Cross-platform. DisplayCluster works in both Linux and Mac OSX environments.
* Media viewing. View video content and high-resolution imagery (up to gigapixels in size).
* Pixel streaming. Stream desktops or applications from remote sources to the display.
* Interaction. Multiple users can interact with the display using devices such as:
  + Joysticks
  + Gamepad controllers
  + Touch-enabled devices: iPhone, iPad, iTouch, Android devices
* Scriptability. DisplayCluster is fully scriptable via a Python API.

The DisplayCluster software is available for download on [GitHub](http://www.github.com/TACC). DisplayCluster is free software issued by the University of Texas at Austin under the BSD license. Please see the LICENSE file for details.
