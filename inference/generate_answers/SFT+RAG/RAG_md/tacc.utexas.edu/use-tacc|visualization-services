## A state-of-the-art facility where staff explores the intersection between human perception and large-scale visual analysis through the study of visualization and interactive displays.

The Vislab serves as a research hub for human-computer interaction, tiled display software development, and visualization consulting. The main goal of this facility is to support the world-class research being conducted at The University of Texas at Austin.

The Vislab has users from several departments at the university, offering opportunities to faculty, staff and students to use visualization, interaction and computational resources for the exploration and presentation of data. We invite you to explore the facility and envision how this interactive, high performance visualization space can transform your research and events.

### Meet the Vislab Proctors

TACC employs a staff of UT Austin students to serve as proctors for visitors and tours, and assist with TACC visualization research projects. Their majors vary and the job provides unique experience in teamwork as well as public speaking confidence. Prior experience in visualization is not necessary and interested parties should contact the Vislab manager for more information.
