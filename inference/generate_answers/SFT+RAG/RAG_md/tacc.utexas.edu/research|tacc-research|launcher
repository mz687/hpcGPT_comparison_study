# The Launcher

### Purpose

The Launcher is a framework for running large collections of serial or multi-threaded applications, known as High Throughput Computing (HTC), as a single multi-node parallel job on batch-scheduled High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.

### Overview

Many HPC systems discourage the submission of serial or single-node jobs, instead encouraging larger parallel runs. Additionally, many HPC systems either discourage or prohibit queuing hundreds of jobs at a time in order to make these systems more available for large-scale parallel jobs. And while many batch-scheduling tools provide a throughput feature called job arrays, these are sometimes restricted in size or disabled entirely.

The Launcher circumvents these problems by allowing the user to create their own miniature high throughput machine inside of a single multi-node parallel job submitted to a large-scale HPC resource. Once started, the launcher independently manages the execution of a user's application batch on the provided nodes, with extremely low overhead and almost no learning curve.

The Launcher is very customizable, allowing users to select various scheduling methods and processes per node. Launcher also has automatic process-to-core binding in order to achieve better performance on modern multi- and many-core architectures.

### Impact

Launcher is used on all of TACC's production systems, and is the integrated into several gateways and frameworks, including:

* DrugDiscovery@TACC
* VDJServer
* Agave

Launcher is being utilized at sites throughout the U.S. and around the world to quickly generate large-scale parametric runs for later analysis.
