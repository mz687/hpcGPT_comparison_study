Dr. Schopf oversees the NSF Engagement and Performance Operations Center, a joint effort with the Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Science Network (ESnet), which broadly supports the full workflow for data transfers, from scientist support to architectural design, and across all levels of cyberinfrastructure. She is also the PI for the University of Texas at Austin's Open Source Program Office (UT-OSPO), a Sloan Foundation-funded effort to broaden the use of open source software across the institution. She works closely the University of Texas system institutions to support the use of the Texas research and educational networks (OTS and LEARN), as well as supporting various NSF, DOE, and NIH projects in understanding user requirements and how to build cyberinfrastructure to meet those needs.

Schopf received doctoral and master degrees in Computer Science and Engineering from University of California San Diego, where she worked with Dr. Fran Berman. Prior to joining TACC, she was director of the International Networks at Indiana University, where she doubled the funding for the program and expanded its reach to include significant work in Africa. She has held research appointments at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the University of Edinburgh, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University. She has also spent time as an NSF program officer, a senior staff member for Globus, and a program director at the IEEE Computer Society.
