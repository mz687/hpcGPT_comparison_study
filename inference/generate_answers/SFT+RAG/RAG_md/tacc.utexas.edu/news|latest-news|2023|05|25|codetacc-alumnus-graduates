Jan Carlos Rubio earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin. Rubio, a Mexican immigrant in the U.S. on an A-2 visa, attributes his drive and success to his upbringing.

It is an exciting time for The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) graduates this month who are donning black caps and gowns as they graduate from one of the [top 10](https://news.utexas.edu/2023/04/25/u-s-news-ranks-ut-austin-among-best-in-u-s-for-graduate-studies/) public universities in the country!

One of these amazing students is [Jan Carlos Rubio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-carlos-rubio-sanchez/), who just earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering. Rubio says his career aspirations started with the Code@TACC outreach program at UT Austin’s [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) (TACC).

“Being a Code@TACC camper was one of the most exciting experiences of my life,” Rubio said. “Back in 2018, I had the opportunity to collaborate with other campers and create beautiful memories simply by learning about cybersecurity.”

After his Cybersecurity camp experience, Rubio realized he wanted to pursue a career in computer science. He enrolled at UT Austin in Fall 2019 and served as a volunteer for Code@TACC Robotics, Connected, and Cybersecurity camps from 2020-2022.

Rubio became aware of [Code@TACC camps](https://tacc.utexas.edu/education/k-12-students/) by a computer science teacher at C.C. Winn High School in Eagle Pass, Texas, a small town on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Since its inception in 2015, TACC’s signature camps have served more than 500 students, the majority coming from African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx backgrounds. Hundreds of these campers go on to pursue postsecondary education in STEM fields.

Rubio applied for the 2017 Robotics camp but wasn’t selected. The following summer, he applied again and was selected for the 2018 Cybersecurity camp.

“I’m glad I didn't give up because the Cybersecurity camp put me on a path that has defined my college education,” Rubio said.

Dawn Hunter, a program manager with TACC’s Education & Outreach (E&O) team, supervises the camp volunteers and remembers Rubio as being a joyful volunteer who always wanted to help others.

“It was clear that Jan was someone I could depend on,” Hunter said. “He always sought more responsibilities and never made excuses for things that may have gone awry.”

Hunter and others on the TACC E&O team make a concerted effort to visit high schools, local businesses, and churches to promote Code@TACC camps. Staff members recruit students who are new to coding and camp experiences, or who may not know how to access or navigate higher education.

Seeing Rubio’s success gives Hunter a sense of happiness.

“In 2018, he was a high schooler wondering how he could get started in computer science — now, he’s a UT graduate with a STEM degree and a bright future. Watching him pursue his passions is exciting for the E&O team,” Hunter said. “Against all odds, he pushed through and never gave up.”

Fellow Code@TACC alum [Jayla House](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/news/latest-news/2022/06/07/codetacc-alumna-graduates-texas-state-computer-science-degree/) fondly remembers her time alongside Rubio. House was an attendee of the 2018 Cybersecurity camp with Rubio and joined him as a volunteer during the 2022 camps.

“Volunteering with Jan was delightful,” House said. “It’s not every day I meet someone who is passionate and driven while also being compassionate and having such a positive attitude.”

Rubio, a Mexican immigrant in the U.S. on an A-2 visa, attributes his drive and success to his upbringing.

> “I wasn’t sure if I could afford living in Austin or if a non-citizen could even apply to UT, but that didn’t stop me. With hard work, I was accepted into UT, admitted into the UT Electrical Engineering Program, and earned an automatic tuition exemption for being at the top of my high school class.”

“My time at UT Austin has been challenging because I am a first-generation, international student, and financial opportunities are limited when you lack citizenship,” Rubio said. “Ironically, having financial disadvantages has helped me become a better engineer because I learned problem-solving skills and how to maximize my limited resources.”

Rubio’s mother, Claudia, graduated in 1996 from El Instituto Tecnologico de Piedras Negras (the Piedras Negras Institute of Technology) as a systems engineer. Upon moving to the U.S., her engineering qualifications were invalidated, and she was forced to work minimum-wage jobs to help her family pay the bills. Despite these obstacles, she always reminded Jan to *ponerse trucha* — “stay on top of your game.”

Heeding his mother’s guiding principle, Rubio graduated high school as valedictorian. This achievement automatically offered him admission to a state school under a 1997 Texas law (HB 588) which guarantees that students who graduate in the top 10% of their high school class are granted automatic admission to state-funded universities.

For Rubio, UT Austin was his only preference.

“I wasn’t sure if I could afford living in Austin or if a non-citizen could even apply to UT, but that didn’t stop me,” Rubio said. "With hard work, I was accepted into UT, admitted into the [UT Electrical Engineering Program](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/), and earned an automatic tuition exemption for being at the top of my high school class.”

Now that he is a UT Austin graduate, Rubio is thinking about the future.

“If I could plan out the next five years, I would stay in Austin and work as a software engineer for a company dedicated to societal improvement,” he said. “I am looking for a visa sponsorship to pursue a career in software engineering here in the U.S.”

For the Code@TACC team at TACC, Rubio’s success and forward-looking goals are in perfect alignment with the mission of the camps.

“TACC engages K-12 students in STEM exploration activities that introduce them to how computing impacts society,” Hunter said. “We couldn’t be more excited for Jan!”
