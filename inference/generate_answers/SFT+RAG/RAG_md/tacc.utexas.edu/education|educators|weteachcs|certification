#### Application Steps

1. You will be required to Create a UT EID (if you do not have one), or Login with your UT EID.
2. You will be prompted to complete your profile in UTakeIt.
3. You will then be able to Start the Application.

### Learn About CS Certification

Please visit Pearson's website for details and registration: <http://www.tx.nesinc.com>

Passing the Texas Education Agency's (TEA) Computer Science 8-12 Certification Test, Test Code 241 (CS 8-12 Test) is required to teach the following high school programming-based courses: Fundamentals of CS (can also be taught in Middle School), CS I, CS II and CS III. See the [TEA's CS course detail](http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter130/ch130o.html#130.420) for more information on each course. This test is also recommended to teach the two Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science courses: [AP Computer Science Principles](http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/231724.html) and [AP Computer Science A](http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/4483.html). Please note that while some resources are free, there are also approximately $180 in TEA registration and application fees for the test and certification. WeTeach\_CS provides a limited number of $1000 stipends for teachers who become CS certified. It is essential that you apply for the CIP program before registering for the test to verify availability. The Register and Take Test section provides details.

The CS 8-12 Test 241 covers four domains. (Scoring weight indicated below.)

* **Domain I – Technology Applications Core** (12.5%)  

  Understand how to use applications, data, networks, and the Internet to complete simple tasks and large projects.
* **Domain II – Program Design and Development** (35%)  
  Understand how to design and plan coding efforts.
* **Domain III – Programming Language Topics** (40%)  
  Write code using data, data types, arrays, loops, control structures, and data structures.
* **Domain IV – Specialized Topics** (12.5%)  

  This section covers advanced topics such as robotics, digital forensics, discrete math, and game design.

### Prepare

If you have a standard or lifetime TEA teaching certificate and a bachelor's degree, you can earn a CS certification via the TEA's [Certification By Exam](http://tea.texas.gov/interiorpage.aspx?id=25769812518) option, which involves passing the CS 8-12 Test. This path requires that you learn the CS content and related pedagogy on your own before taking the test. Test preparation is a significant amount of work. For most teachers, this effort will include one or two years of learning, practice and professional development. Note that if you don't have experience using computer applications, networks, and the Internet, we recommend that you pursue these types of experiences before taking on CS certification.

There are many paths to prepare for the test. For example, if you have significant programming experience, you might be able to pass the test without preparing. Also, there are multiple content providers (Code.org, Code Academy, etc.) and languages (Java, Javascript, and Python) that you could choose, based on your preference. If you are looking for direction in this area, we outline one path that will prepare you for the test. Choose the button below to view and print a detailed checklist.

* Learn Block-Based Programming
* Learn Text-Based Programming
* Take the CS 8-12 Certification Prep Course ([Texas](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/foundations-of-cs-texes-prep/) or [Praxis](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/foundations-cs-praxis/)) – Online
* Take the CS 8-12 Certification Prep Course ([Texas](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/professional-development/WTCS_CertPrep/) or [Praxis](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/professional-development/WTCS_PraxisPrep/)) – In-Person

#### Currently Certified Teachers

### Start Teaching!

Congratulations! We wish you the best in the classroom and your career!

### Professional Development and Curriculum

WeTeach\_CS offers online and in-person trainings to prepare for the certification exam. We also encourage new CS teachers to apply for participation in the [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals) program. This program, supported by Microsoft Philanthropies, connects classroom teachers with tech-industry volunteers to create sustainable CS programs. Volunteers support teachers as they learn to teach CS independently over time. It is FREE to schools.

### In-Person

WTCS certification prep is a three-day training providing an overview of the educator competencies required of all teachers to become certified in Grades 8-12 Computer Science. This certification is necessary to teach courses such as Computer Science I, II or III, Fundamentals of Computer Science, or AP Computer Science A. Course instructors will address several competencies in depth and link attendees to additional resources that will help to prepare them to take the TExES 241 CS 8-12 Certification Test. It's recommended that participants be familiar with technology application concepts and have some experience with a non-block programming language, such as Java or Python. This course is offered throughout the year.

In-person trainings are provided [throughout the year.](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/events/)

These are offered throughout Texas. If you would like to bring a face-to-face praxis prep training to your state, contact [Carol Fletcher](mailto:cfletcher@tacc.utexas.edu). WeTeach\_CS can provide direct training to teachers in your state and can also train your trainers to deliver this workshop.
