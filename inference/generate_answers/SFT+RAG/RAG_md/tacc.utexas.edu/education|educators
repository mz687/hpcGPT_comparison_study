## Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC)

EPIC's mission is to broaden participation in K20 computing pathways through research, outreach, professional development, and policy advocacy. To achieve this mission, we partner with school districts, institutions of higher education, industry leaders, and federal, state and local government entities who are also dedicated to expanding access and opportunity for historically underserved students in computing. EPIC also provides evaluation and technology services to external entities to help advance their STEM education research and outreach.

### Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP) Alliance

ECEP is a 23 state alliance with the goal to broaden participation in computing by identifying and addressing the policies, pathways, and practices in state education systems that are barriers to diverse student engagement and success.

ECEP state leaders believe that improving equitable capacity for, access to, participation in, and experiences of CS education will increase the number and diversity of students in computing and computing-intensive degree pathways in their states.
