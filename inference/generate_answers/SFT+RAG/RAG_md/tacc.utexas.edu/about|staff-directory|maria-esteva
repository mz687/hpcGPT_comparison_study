## Research Scientist Data and AI

Phone: **512-232-8478** |
Email: **[maria@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:maria@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Maria earned her Ph.D. in Information Science from The University of Texas at Austin with an Advanced Certificate in Preservation Administration. Her research focuses on large-scale data curation and preservation including the design, implementation, and evaluation of data curation applications. She is the data curator for the Core Trust Seal Certified [DesignSafe](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/) Data Depot Repository and the [Digital Rocks Portal](https://www.digitalrocksportal.org/) which are both developed and maintained at TACC. In both she works with interdisciplinary teams of scientists and developers designing developing interactive curation and publication pipelines, implementing data impact metrics, policies and best practices, and assisting users. She works at the intersection of data curation and AI to create Findable, Accessible, Reusable and Interoperable (FAIR) datasets. Her current work with the UT Good Systems project Living and Working with Robots includes guiding researchers and training students to curate and publish their [datasets](https://dataverse.tdl.org/dataverse/robotics) as well as the creation of a Human Robotics convergence data model that connects diverse robotics AI ready datasets through a knowledge graph.

Prior to joining TACC, Maria was an assistant instructor in the UT Austin School of Information. She also worked as a graduate research assistant in the UT Austin Digital Library Services Division where she worked in a variety of areas including text encoding, metadata, institutional repository implementation, and image collections.
