Toni Dunlap joined TACC and EPIC in August of 2024. Utilizing her prior knowledge and experience as a classroom teacher -- teaching computer science (CS) at the 6th - 12th grade level -- Toni will develop and deliver CS PD experiences. Toni is also a proud member of the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA), where she currently serves on the inaugural council of the CSTA Equity Fellowship. Additionally, Toni has served as a CS/robotics curriculum writer for Robolink, Inc. and a reflective practice coach to first-year educators participating in UPenn's Day School Teaching Residency program.

A native of Atlanta, GA, Toni moved to Colorado to pursue an undergraduate degree in CS from the University of Denver. During her time as an undergraduate student, Toni recognized she had a passion for working in roles that involve mentorship, lesson planning, community organizing, and exposing others to CS/STEAM pathways. This ultimately led her to pursue a career in CS education, which has proven to be a perfect fit â€“ a position that allows her to explore both her love of CS and people.
