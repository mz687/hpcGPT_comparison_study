I joined TACC in the summer of 2016 and led the Java design and implementation efforts for Aloe and Tapis v2 and v3. I have a strong interest in databases, security and distributed systems and I'm involved in the National Science Foundation's ICICLE AI Institute. Lately, I've been using Rust to implement safety-critical and performance-sensitive code. When not at work I enjoy motorcycling, bicycling, hiking and the occasional good beer.
