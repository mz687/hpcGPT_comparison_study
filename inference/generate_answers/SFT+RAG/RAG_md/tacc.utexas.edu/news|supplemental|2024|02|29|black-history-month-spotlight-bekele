The Education & Outreach (E&O) programs at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) inspire students to reach their full potential. E&O has intentionally developed strategic programming aimed at broadening participation in computing.

[Rahel Bekele](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahel-bekele-2b27bb24b/) is an undergraduate student majoring in mechanical engineering at UT Austin. In 2021, Bekele attended Code@TACC Connected, where high school students explored the relationship between coding and communities. During the 2021-2022 school year, Bekele served as a student leader for TACC’s [Vislab](//tacc.utexas.edu/use-tacc/visualization-services/).

We caught up with Bekele to hear about her experiences as a Black student in STEM, her memories of Code@TACC, and the importance of teaching STEM to the next generation.

**E&O/TACC:** What inspired you to study STEM?

**Rahel Bekele:** After moving to a more diverse school from a predominantly white institution, the STEM opportunities that I had previously were not available at my new school. I realized the importance of representation in STEM and saw the underrepresentation of people of color as a limit that needed to be overcome. It wasn’t a lack of interest or capability, but a lack of opportunities and representation.

**E&O/TACC:** How did you first learn about Code@TACC?

**Rahel Bekele:** One of my high school counselors introduced me to the program, saying it was the perfect summer camp. During my time at Code@TACC Connected, I worked on projects using networked sensors, collected data, and created models for environmentally relevant problems. I learned how to effectively use data to tell a compelling science story. Code@TACC deepened my understanding of the real-world applications of STEM. I recall feeling anxious before camp started because of my lack of experience with coding and technology, but the supportive staff guided me through the learning process.

**E&O/TACC:** What’s the coolest thing about the Vislab?

**Rahel Bekele:** I love seeing researchers’ work presented on Stallion. The high-quality resolution screen brings their works to life — anything displayed on Stallion looks stunning!

**E&O/TACC:** What advice would you give a student interested in studying or teaching STEM?

**Rahel Bekele:** Believe in yourself and your capabilities, and don’t let anyone discourage you from pursuing your dreams. Seek guidance from those who have walked the STEM path before you and connect with students who have graduated. Lastly, join relevant organizations and build a network. Such connections can provide valuable mentorship, support, and a sense of community that is crucial for success in a STEM career.

**E&O/TACC:** Why should STEM students participate in Education & Outreach programs?

**Rahel Bekele:** These programs support students considering STEM careers by introducing you to a community of wonderful people. There are many opportunities for networking and mentorship. The connections I’ve made have opened doors to unique experiences and paved the way for a successful journey to a future STEM career.

**E&O/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to STEM, Ms. Bekele.

Code@TACC was made possible as a no-cost-to-student program with support from: Cisco/Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Harman-Mayes-Sooch Family Fund, KLE Foundation, National Science Foundation, National Security Agency, and industry partners including Mellanox, BP, and Dell.
