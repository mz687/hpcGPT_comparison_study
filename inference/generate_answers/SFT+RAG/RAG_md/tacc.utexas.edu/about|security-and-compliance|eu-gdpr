# European Union General Data Protection Regulations (EU GDPR)

The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) is working towards compliance with the [European Union General Data Protection Regulations](https://gdpr-info.eu) â€” the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.

The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data, wholly or partly, by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.

TACC protects the rights for the protection of personal data.
