# Research Experience for Undergraduates

## Cyberinfrastructure Research for Societal Advancement | June 2 – August 1, 2025

The National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site: Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Research for Societal Advancement engages 10 undergraduate students majoring in science and engineering disciplines each summer for a nine-week advanced computing research experience at The University of Texas at Austin.

Students receive training using national CI by integrating the learning of computational science, data-enabled science, and multidisciplinary science and conduct cutting-edge research in preparation for graduate programs and the workforce.
