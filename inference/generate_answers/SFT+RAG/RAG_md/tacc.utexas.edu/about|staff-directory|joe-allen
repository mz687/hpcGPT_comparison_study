Joe Allen joined the TACC Life Sciences Computing Group in 2015 where he works to advance computational biology and bioinformatics research at UT system academic and health institutions. His research experience spans a range of disciplines from computer-aided drug design to wet lab biochemistry. He is also interested in exploring new ways high performance computing resources can be used to answer challenging biological questions. Before joining TACC, Joe earned a B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Jamestown (2006), and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Virginia Tech (2011).
