Frontera is the largest academic supercomputer in the world. Located at The University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing
Center (TACC), Frontera is tailored towards the very largest of scientific computing projects. This quick-start guide covers an
architecture overview, the user environment, file storage and data movement, compiling code, and running jobs.

##### Objectives

After you complete this roadmap, you should be able to:

* Summarize Fronteraâ€™s system architecture
* Explain the steps to get a Frontera allocation
* Configure the shell environment
* Explain how to store and move data
* Compile a C/C++ or Fortran code with appropriate compiler options
* Identify the correct queue for a job
* Explain the procedure for submitting a job to the Slurm scheduler

##### Prerequisites

Frontera is a leadership-class system, so its prospective users are already likely to have a high degree of familiarity and experience
with HPC and parallel computing. The pace of this presentation is meant to be relatively brisk, for that reason.

With that being understood, there are no formal prerequisites for this Virtual Workshop topic. A working knowledge of Linux is *recommended*; if you need more preparation in Linux, try working through the [Linux](/linux) roadmap first.

##### Requirements

You will need access to Frontera through the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) (TACC).

Access to Frontera can be requested by submitting an [allocation request](https://fronteraweb.tacc.utexas.edu/allocations/) to TACC.
