[Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) is a user-friendly cloud computing environment
that is designed to provide configurable cyberinfrastucture to researchers.
To learn more about Jetstream2's features and how to use it,
visit the topic [Introduction to Jetstream2](/Jetstream).
Programmatic access to Jetstream2 is available through its various
Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs), which are described in the advanced topic
[Using the Jetstream2 APIs](/JetstreamAPI).

This topic describes techniques for deploying cloud components on Jetstream2
using the "orchestration" system [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
Orchestration systems automate and simplify the process of deploying
a desired configuration of instances, networking, etc. to a cloud computing environment.
This subject matter presumes previous experience with cloud computing on Jetstream2,
including familiarity with its APIs, and is not meant for inexperienced users.

##### Objectives

After you complete this roadmap, you should be able to:

* Understand the benefits of orchestrating deployments to cloud computing environments.
* Understand the benefits of using Terraform to perform such deployments.
* Perform some basic deployments on Jetstream2 using Terraform.
* Perform some provisioning of deployed Jetstream2 resources through Terraform.

This topic does not attempt to teach:

* How to use Jetstream2 or its Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs).
* *All* of the functionality available in Terraform.
* Details for using Terraform to deploy Jetstream2 components for any *specific* application.

##### Prerequisites

* Complete the [Introduction to Jetstream2](/Jetstream) tutorial.
* Complete the [Using the Jetstream2 APIs](/JetstreamAPI) topic,
  which introduces terminology and procedures that are
  also relevant when using tools like Terraform to deploy to Jetstream2.

##### Requirements

To perform the steps outlined in this roadmap you will need:

* An [ACCESS](https://access-ci.org/) User ID, which may be obtained from the
  [ACCESS User Registration page](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user).
* An ACCESS allocation.
  ACCESS provides [complete information](https://allocations.access-ci.org/) about its allocations,
  while Jetstream2 provides [an overview](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/alloc/overview/)
  of the types of allocations that are available,
  with links to detailed information about allocations in the context of Jetstream2.
