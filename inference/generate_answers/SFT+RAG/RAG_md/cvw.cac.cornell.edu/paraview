[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) is a highly capable visualization application for computational fluid dynamics and other subjects.
It is open source and can run in parallel.
This topic includes exercises that create visualizations of a sample dataset on both a local computer and on the
[Stampede2](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2/) and [Frontera](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/frontera) supercomputers
at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/).

##### Objectives

After you complete this workshop, you should be able to:

* List the major elements of the ParaView user interface
* Name the types of data that can be visualized in ParaView
* Describe some of the most common visualization functionalities available in ParaView
* Demonstrate combining functionalities to produce a complete data visualization
* Demonstrate logging on to the TACC Analysis Portal to render large data sets

##### Prerequisites

There are no formal prerequisites for this course.

##### Requirements

Requirements for this topic include:

* Download the lastest version of [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/) and install it.
* Download a [zip file](/paraview/data.zip) containing the RectGrid2.vtk and headsq.vtk data sets
