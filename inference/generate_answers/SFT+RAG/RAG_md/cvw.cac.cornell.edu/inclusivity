## Inclusivity Statement

CAC is committed to providing training materials that foster inclusion and show respect for all, including in the terminology we use,
and in the way we display and provide information. In the event that we have inadvertently included inappropriate, inaccessible or offensive materials,
whether verbal, written, or graphical, please let us know at [help@cac.cornell.edu](mailto:help@cac.cornell.edu?subject=CVW Inclusivity).
In our materials on software libraries and directives,
please note that we are constrained to follow the associated technical specifications. We expect terminology improvements will be implemented
by all software providers soon, and we will update these materials accordingly.
