[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) is a highly capable visualization application
for computational fluid dynamics and other subjects.
It is open source and can run in parallel on resources at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/).
This topic provides high level introductions to several of ParaView's more advanced features.

##### Objectives

After you complete this workshop, you should be able to:

* Explore source data and describe its contents
* Generate animated visualizations with moving cameras and changing parameter values
* Create new, derived data values using Calculator filters
* Use Python to script the steps of your ParaView session for easy repetition
* Use Python to create pipeline sources and filters to process data in new ways
* Use Python to create new "views" that display your data in new ways
* Demonstrate writing and using C++ plugins that contain sharable extensions to ParaView's functionality
* Connect ParaView to a running simulation using Catalyst to provide in situ visualizations
* Explain how to improve visualizations using OSPRay's rendering features

##### Prerequisites

* Complete the basic [ParaView tutorial](/paraview).

##### Requirements

System requirements include:

* Download the lastest version of [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/) and install it.
* Download a [zip file](/paraview/data.zip) containing the RectGrid2.vtk and headsq.vtk data sets
