This module provides an introduction to concepts of visualization with a focus on parallel computing techniques to handle large datasets.
It should clarify some of the choices you have when configuring visualization tools such as ParaView for use on Stampede2 or Frontera.

##### Objectives

After you complete this workshop, you should be able to:

* Describe the technical concepts of visualization
* Explain how visualization can be parallelized in order to process and debug large datasets
  on distributed machines such as Stampede2 and Frontera using [ParaView](/ParaView/).

##### Prerequisites

* A basic understanding of computer graphics (at the coordinates/polygon level)
* Some elements of this topic refer to [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/);
  this topic and the [ParaView topic](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/Paraview/) could be read in parallel

##### Requirements

* Have a [TACC Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/) username.
  Readers without a username should Create a [TACC User Portal account](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request).
* Have an allocation on one or more TACC resources.
  Visit [TACC's Allocation Guide](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/allocations-overview) to learn about obtaining a resource allocation.
