The Education & Outreach (E&O) programs at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) inspire students to reach their full potential. E&O has intentionally developed strategic programming aimed at broadening participation in computing.

[Jordan Williams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-williams-13070419b/) participated in the 2021 [Research Experience for Undergraduates](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/undergraduates-graduates/reu/) (REU) program. After earning a Computer Science degree from Grambling State University in 2022, he worked as a research intern at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory during the summer of 2023. Currently, Jordan is pursuing a master’s in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT).

We caught up with Williams to hear about his experiences in STEM, his memories of TACC’s REU program, and his future aspirations.

**E&O/TACC:** What inspired you to work in STEM?

**Jordan Williams:** Growing up in Monroe, Louisiana, and attending schools where most students and teachers were Black provided me with ample exposure to educators who shared my racial background. My high school science teacher and National Honor Society program director, Ms. Grover, played a significant role in shaping my aspirations for a STEM career. The engaging science projects and invaluable life lessons I learned under her guidance remain vivid in my memory, serving as a constant source of inspiration. These experiences motivated me to pursue higher education at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), which offer a supportive and nurturing environment where Black students can thrive. My experiences at HBCUs further reinforced the importance of representation and mentorship in shaping the trajectory of one’s career.

**E&O/TACC:** How did you first learn about TACC’s REU program?

**Jordan Williams:** While searching for internships, I stumbled upon the NSF REU website and found more than 100 summer research opportunities in Computer & Information Science and Engineering. Among these, TACC caught my attention, particularly the Cyberinfrastructure: Research for Social Change program. I wanted to learn about the creation of data visualization analytic systems and how to apply these skills to address pressing social issues, so I applied.

**E&O/TACC:** What are some key lessons you learned during your time in the program?

**Jordan Williams:** Scientific inquiry is a deliberate, methodical process that requires patience and perseverance. I gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies involved in conducting research, including the importance of collaboration with specialized scientists and faculty members. It wasn’t until halfway through our 10-week program that I honed in on the specific focus of my project. Once clarity dawned, I found myself consumed by a newfound passion. Considering it was my inaugural foray into the realm of research, I’m grateful for the patience, guidance, and support of my mentors, Drs. Justin Drake and Kelly Gaither at TACC.

**E&O/TACC:** What advice would you give a teacher interested in teaching STEM?

**Jordan Williams:** In the face of challenges, remain resilient and steadfast in advocating for equity in STEM education. Your unwavering dedication will profoundly impact and empower the next generation of STEM leaders. Embrace your identity and the unique perspectives you bring to the classroom. Your experiences have the power to enrich STEM education by offering diverse insights for students. Engage in professional development opportunities to refine your skills and remain abreast of the latest advancements in the field. Introduce hands-on learning experiences to captivate students and cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. As a STEM teacher, you are a visible role model — share your personal journey in STEM and inspire students to pursue their passions with confidence.

**E&O/TACC:** Why should STEM professionals support Education & Outreach (E&O) programs?

**Jordan Williams:** Engaging with Education & Outreach initiatives allows STEM workers to serve as role models and mentors for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Collaborating with E&O programs provides STEM workers with opportunities to directly confront systemic barriers that hinder access to STEM education and opportunities. Participating in E&O programs may also lead to sponsorship funding for STEM initiatives.

**E&O/TACC:**Thank you for your time and contributions to STEM, Mr. Williams.

With TACC’s REU program, students gain skills in advanced programming and problem solving and use cyberinfrastructure to conduct cutting-edge research in engineering, science, and computational medicine. Research projects emphasize advanced computing as a tool to power discoveries that will impact social change for future generations.
