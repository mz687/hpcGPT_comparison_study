# Experimental Data Architectures

### Purpose

The explosion of data generated and utilized in contemporary research requires new solutions for reliable and economical storage of huge, complex datasets. A number of efforts at TACC focus on novel architectures at multiple scales and levels within the data management stack, from individual server systems to distributed data management architectures, with the goal of simplifying data management for administrators and researchers while reducing the overall cost of next-generation storage systems.
