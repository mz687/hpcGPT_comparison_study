# Technology Services

## EPIC's Technology Services division designs and supports a variety of custom web applications to assist in operational processes needed to run an effective research, service, governmental, or non-profit organization.

We work with partners and clients to create secure web forms, payment gateways, registration systems, and web-based compliance reporting systems. Our applications are secured using enterprise-level security standards and updated regularly. Below are examples of projects our team currently services.
