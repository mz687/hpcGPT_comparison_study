# Water flowing through limestone

### Science Behind the Image

This image shows the path of water through the karst limestone structure of a ground sample taken from south Florida. The photorealistic shading enhances the analysis of the stone porosity and the spatial arrangement of the flow traces.

### Visualization Behind the Image

This image was generated using a ray-tracing framework supported in part by NSF grants ACI 13-39863 and ACI 1134872, and the image was generated on TACC Stampede, an NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure resource.
