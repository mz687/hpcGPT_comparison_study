## Building Capacity Through Collaboration

Collaborations allow us to train students and educators to meet 21st Century workforce demands, and share and learn effective practices to better represent all communities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.

### NSF INCLUDES Alliance Supporting Pacific Impact through Computational Excellence (ALL-SPICE)

**Enhancing data science education to support sustainability, economic development, and social justice in the Hawai'i-Pacific region.**

The development of a robust data science infrastructure, regional expertise in analytics, and strong linkages to decision support cyberinfrastructure will empower Hawai'i-Pacific communities to provide perspectives rooted in Pacific experiences and epistemology in global opportunities for STEM, data science and policymaking. ALL-SPICE is a collaboration with Chaminade University of Honolulu (CUH), positioned for collective impact on Hawai'i-Pacific data science and a wide coordination network that spans Hawai'i and the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands.

### NSF Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance (BPC-A) Expanding Computing Education Pathways (ECEP)

**Growing computer science graduates, state by state.**

The ECEP Alliance seeks to increase the number of students representative of all communities in the pipeline to computing and computing-intensive degrees by supporting state-level computing education reforms. Through interventions, pathways, partnerships and models that drive state-level computing education change, ECEP supports states as they work to align their state efforts with the national vision of computer science for all.

### Advanced Computing for Social Change (ACSC)

**A weeklong program providing a national, undergraduate student data science experience.**

The program brings together students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds for a transformative learning experience that encourages creating social change through advanced computing.
