## Tutorials

### Containers for HPC Reproducibility: Building, Deploying, and Optimizing

#### Presenters: Erik Ferlanti, John Fonner

Software containers have gained immense popularity as an effective means for enhancing the portability and reproducibility of high-performance computing (HPC) applications. This hands-on workshop is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to building, running, and distributing Docker and Singularity/Apptainer containers specifically tailored for HPC environments. Participants will receive in-depth guidance on creating HPC-compliant containers that are not only suitable for local testing and development but also optimized for deployment on advanced HPC systems.Special attention will be given to the intricacies of building containers that can run on multiple nodes using MPI and using accelerated hardware such as GPUs. Moreover, the workshop will delve into best practices for containerization in HPC contexts, troubleshooting common issues, and strategies for ensuring the seamless integration of containers into existing HPC workflows. By the end of the session, attendees will be equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage the full potential of HPC containers, contributing to more efficient, reproducible, and scalable computing solutions.

### Reproducible ML Workflows and Deployments with Tapis

#### Presenters: Joe Stubbs, Christian Garcia, Nathan Freeman, Anagha Jamthe, Steve Black, Gilbert Curbelo

This tutorial aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive introduction to the latest reproducible Machine Learning (ML) workflows and tooling provided by the NSF-funded Tapis v3 Application Programming Interface (API) and User Interface (UI). Through hands-on exercises, participants will gain experience in querying pre-trained ML models from public ML infrastructures such as Hugging Face or the ICICLE AI Institute, deploying various ML work-environments, and developing ML workflows on national-scale supercomputing resources. Throughout this tutorial, we will focus on utilizing the Tapis Workflows API, Tapis Pods API, Tapis ML Hub API, and TapisUI. These production-grade services are designed to simplify the facilitation and creation of trustworthy, reproducible, scientific workflows. By abstracting the complexities of underlying technologies behind user-friendly APIs, the Tapis services enable seamless integration with high performance computing (HPC) resources available at institutions with a Tapis deployment. Ultimately the tutorial aims to empower researchers to efficiently develop, deploy, and maintain their own ML workflows.

### CUDA Programming: Basic Concepts in C and Fortran

#### Presenter: Lars Koesterke

Effective CUDA code differs from conventional code as it has to reflect and accommodate architectural features of GPUs. In this tutorial I will discuss several key elements of the hardware and the software, i.e. how the execution of a loop matches the grid and block structure of the hardware, how user-managed cache memory is leveraged for speed, and how data is transferred asynchronously from host to device. The tutorial is intended for intermediate-level C/C++ and Fortran programmers who are interested in making the first steps towards CUDA programming for GPUs.

### Modern C++ for Computational Science

#### Presenter: Victor Eijkhout

C++ has seen increasing popularity in computational science in recent years, and accordingly the standard has started including features that accommodate such use. One of the main innovations in recent C++ standards is the use of ranges and range algorithm, which is a more elegant, and less error-prone way of expressing data parallel loops. We cover the basic concepts of ranges and range adapters, as well as lambda expression which are often used in range algorithms. There are various ways that ranges can be used in parallel processing, and we will cover several of these: including OpenMP integration, and the standard mechanism of parallel execution policies. The second relevant innovation is true multi-dimensional array handling. This comes from the `mdspan' library, which rather than providing a new container type, gives a non-owning view into traditional containers such as the standard vector. We will give an example-driven introduction to these concepts, and show how they can be combined to express for instance stencil operations.
