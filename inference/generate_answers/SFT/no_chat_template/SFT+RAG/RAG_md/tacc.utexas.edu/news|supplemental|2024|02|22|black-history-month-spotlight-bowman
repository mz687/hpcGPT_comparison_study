The Education & Outreach (E&O) programs at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) inspire students to reach their full potential. E&O has intentionally developed strategic programming aimed at broadening participation in computing.

[Qwynci Bowman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qwynci/) attended Code@TACC Cybersecurity in 2018 and served as a camp counselor for the virtual camps in 2021. She also participated in [Advanced Computing for Social Change](https://tacc.utexas.edu/partnerships/stem-research/acsci/) in 2020. Bowman is a project developer for EDP Renewables North America who earned her bachelor’s degree in Environmental Studies from Lewis & Clark College in 2022.

We caught up with Bowman to hear about her experiences in STEM, her memories of Code@TACC, and her future aspirations.

**E&O/TACC:** What inspired you to work in STEM?

**Qwynci Bowman:** I was always drawn to technology. It wasn’t until I attended Code@TACC that I felt empowered to pursue a career in computer science. Code@TACC allowed me to immerse myself in a supportive environment where I could learn from mentors who looked like me and shared similar experiences. This inspired me to become a camp counselor and support the next generation of computer scientists.

**E&O/TACC:** How did you first learn about Code@TACC, and what’s a key takeaway you remember?

**Qwynci Bowman:** One of my high school computer science teachers passed out flyers for the Code@TACC program. I attended Cybersecurity in 2018 and loved the field trips we took to visit the TACC facilities. At the Visualization Lab, we saw interactive simulations and computer displays that brought complex data to life on the screen in a way I had never seen before. As a counselor, I loved helping first-time coders build robotic cars and navigate through Python coding challenges. Their perspectives and innovative approaches to coding taught me new ways to tackle programming challenges. The overall excitement from campers as their creations came to life was rewarding to witness.

**E&O/TACC:** What are some key lessons you learned during your time at Advanced Computing for Social Change 2020?

**Qwynci Bowman:** We were tasked with finding a solution to and analyzing the COVID-19 pandemic. This allowed us to use computational thinking, data visualization, and supercomputers to analyze real-world events. ACSC 2020 enhanced my problem-solving skills by leveraging technology toward positive social change. Computing and society can work in tandem — seeing this principle in real time was amazing.

**E&O/TACC:** What advice would you give a student interested in studying or teaching STEM?

**Qwynci Bowman:** Do not let anyone deter you from what you know you can achieve. You will experience peers and teachers trying to dictate your path based on their ideas of who you are. Know what you are capable of and move forward in whatever direction you choose.

**E&O/TACC:** Why should STEM students partner with Education & Outreach programs?

**Qwynci Bowman:** E&O programs foster a safe learning environment for professional growth, mentorship, and skill building. TACC provides an avenue where students can engage openly, network with industry professionals, and gain valuable insights into the real-world applications of technology. Students looking to carve out successful technology careers are equipped with the tools they need to thrive.

**E&O/TACC:**Thank you for your time and contributions to STEM, Ms. Bowman.
