# Shell Startup Debug

### Purpose

Shell Startup Debug is used to trace the behavior of the startup scripts on your system.

### Overview

Once installed, any user can create a file (~/.init.sh for bash, zsh, etc) and (~/.init.csh for csh and tcsh) that will turn on the report of the startup behavior.

If you wish to create a file instead of writing to standard out, change the value:

`export SHELL_STARTUP_DEBUG=3`

There will be a separate file for each shell invocation.

### Impact

Shell Startup Debug is installed on all major TACC systems.
