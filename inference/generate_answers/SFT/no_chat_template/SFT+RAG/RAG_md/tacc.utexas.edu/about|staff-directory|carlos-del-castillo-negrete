## Research Associate High Performance Computing

Email: **[cnegrete@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:cnegrete@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Carlos joined the TACC team in 2023 as a Research Associate, bringing a rich academic background and extensive experience in high performance computing, software development, and computational sciences. Prior to joining TACC, he was a Graduate Research Assistant at the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Science, University of Texas at Austin. There, he specialized in developing HPC applications for uncertainty quantification and machine learning applied to coastal storm surge modeling. His role at TACC involves leveraging my expertise to enhance research capabilities through HPC technologies and fostering collaborations across disciplines.
