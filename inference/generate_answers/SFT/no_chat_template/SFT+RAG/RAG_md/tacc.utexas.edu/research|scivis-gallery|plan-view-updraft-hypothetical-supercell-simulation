# Plan View: Updraft in a Hypothetical Supercell Simulation

### Science Behind the Image

An orange surface clipped at 12,000 meters elevation shows 50 m/s vertical Wind Velocity, grey is strong Vorticity Magnitude. Using a simplified weather map color key, the Radar Reflectivity background shows precipitation intensity at 500 meters above ground. The hook echo pattern at lower left often reveals severe weather.
