As AI rapidly makes its way into the various facets of our lives, the discourse around its power – and potential problems – is at an all time high. One hot spot where these conversations are occurring is in discussions around K-12 education. How are (and should) educators be integrating AI into their classroom instruction and pedagogy? This topic was on the agenda with policymakers in Washington, D.C. during Computer Science Education Week (CSEdWeek) last month. Representatives from the White House, National Science Foundation (NSF), National Economic Council, and other federal agencies convened to discuss AI in K-12 education, inclusive AI instruction, and the role of AI in CS education and workforce development.

In an era defined by rapid technological advancements, computational thinking and digital literacy are skills that will have a significant impact on population well-being, success, and quality of life. With this in mind, educators are — and should be — preparing their students as early as elementary school for navigating a tech-savvy world in a manner that empowers them to be creators — and not just users — of technology. Texas is making strides in realizing this for students across the state.

Computer science (CS) education in the U.S. is plagued with professional isolation. This is true for classroom teachers who may be the lone CS educator in their school or district, and it is also true of administrators who have no other district leaders with which to collaborate in building CS programs. While efforts are being made to bring CS teachers together, little is currently being done to connect administrators. To tackle these issues, the Texas CS Leadership Network (TXCSLN) will host monthly virtual meetings centered around topics, such as building CS pathways, policies that impact diverse CS enrollment, and strategies for retaining CS teachers. [Sign up today](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/TXCSLN/)! The network’s first meeting is scheduled for **September 25** from 3-4 p.m. The meeting will be held virtually.

**From EPIC’s Allen Antoine: 3 Low-Tech Ways to Teach Computer Science**  

Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting Johannesburg, South Africa, to present at a STEAM-focused teacher professional development conference focused on innovation. During one of my sessions, I discussed how to encourage students to be self-starters when tackling programming projects and unlock their potential to collaborate and be better problem solvers. Read my **[three low-tech ways](https://www.edutopia.org/article/teaching-computer-science-without-computers)** to teach computer science! While high-tech resources are necessary and useful for practical applications and advanced topics, integrating low-tech approaches can improve critical-thinking skills and foster a solid foundation for students to explore computing pathways.

**Why Do Schools Need CS Education?**  

The 2023 **[WeTeach\_CS Summit](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/weteach_cs-summit-2023/)** takes an objective look at a question that's been popping up in education circles: "Do schools really need CS education?" With the jobs of tomorrow looking for the next generation of workers, STEM and CS education are more important than ever! Access to CS courses in high schools across Texas has increased, but the need for more exposure prior to high school is even more important. Rural and urban schools and schools that serve a high percentage of students from low-income families are less likely to offer a foundational CS course and when it is offered Black, Latino, and Native American students are less likely to take the AP CSP exam.

**WeTeach\_CS Launches Rural Certification Collaborative!**  

Students living in rural areas are less likely to attend schools that offer CS courses largely because educational institutions in these remote areas lack the resources to staff teaching positions for these courses. Thanks to the generous support of Jobs for the Future and the U.S. Department of Education, the WeTeach\_CS Rural Certification Collaborative will recruit educators from rural communities to become certified high school CS teachers and increase capacity for students to access a full pathway of CS courses.
