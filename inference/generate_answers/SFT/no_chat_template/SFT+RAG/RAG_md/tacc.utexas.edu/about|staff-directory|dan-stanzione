# Dan Stanzione, Ph.D.

## Associate Vice President For Research Executive Director, TACC

Phone: **512-471-2763** | Email: **[dan@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:dan@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Dr. Dan Stanzione is a nationally recognized leader in the field of high
performance computing who has made an impact in the open science
community for more than 30 years.

He is Executive Director of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC),
one of the leading advanced academic computing centers in the world and
holds the position of Associate Vice President for Research at The University
of Texas at Austin.

Stanzione serves as the principal investigator (PI) for the U.S. National
Science Foundation (NSF) Leadership Class Computing Facility (LCCF), which
started construction in July 2024 and is expected to begin operations in
2026. The LCCF will deploy Horizon, which will be the largest academic
supercomputer dedicated to open science research in the NSF portfolio.

Stanzione is also the PI for several current NSF-funded supercomputers
including Frontera, the fastest supercomputer at a U.S. university, and Vista,
an AI-centric system—all dedicated to open science research.

Stanzione received his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and his
master's degree and doctorate in computer engineering from Clemson
University.
