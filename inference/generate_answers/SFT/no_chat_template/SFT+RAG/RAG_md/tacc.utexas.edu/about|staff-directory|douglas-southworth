# Douglas Southworth

## Engineering Scientist Networking Partnerships

Email: **[dsouthworth@tacc.utexas.edu](mailto:dsouthworth@tacc.utexas.edu)**

Doug joined the TACC team in November 2022 as an Engineering Scientist focused on scientific data movement, network performance visualization, and end-to-end transfer problem diagnosis and repair. Doug's role at TACC centers around ongoing development and deployment of the NetSage flow monitoring and visualization tool, as well as working with the Engagement and Performance Operations Center (EPOC) as a SME in network performance analysis and problem resolution. Previously, Doug worked for International Networks @ Indiana University in many of these same areas, with a consistent focus on simplifying and improving scientific data transfers for researchers.
