## Tutorials

### Trustworthy, Reproducible Machine Learning with Tapis

#### Instructors: Anagha Jamthe, Joe Stubbs, Steve Black

In this tutorial we will focus on effectively leveraging the NSF-funded Tapis v3 Application Program Interface (API) for building a reproducible and trustworthy scientific machine learning workflow. The tutorial will include hands-on exercises, which will enable the attendees to develop Tapis applications based on an ML pipeline available from Hugging Face, that can be seamlessly moved to different execution environments, including a small virtual machine and a national-scale supercomputer.

### Containerized Solutions for HPC Workflows

#### Instructors: Erik Ferlanti, John Fonner

High performance computing (HPC) systems serve a large role in academic computing at scale. In this hands-on tutorial, we will explore methods for running containers on HPC systems including advanced tasks like utilizing GPUs for computation and MPI (Message Passing Interface) for parallel jobs, as well as using Docker to perform multi-stage and multi-architecture builds.

### CUDA Programming: The basic concepts in C and Fortran

#### Instructor: Lars Koesterke, Hanning Chen

Effective CUDA code differs from conventional code as it has to reflect and accommodate architectural features of GPUs. In this tutorial I will discuss several key elements of the hardware and the software, i.e. how the execution of a loop matches the grid and block structure of the hardware, how user-managed cache memory is leveraged for speed, and how data is transferred asynchronously from host to device. The tutorial is intended for intermediate-level C/C++ and Fortran programmers who are interested in making the first steps towards CUDA programming for GPUs.

### Using the UTRC Portal and Uploading Large Datasets

#### Instructors: Tracy Brown, Carrie Arnold, Sophia Massie-Perez

This will be a 2-part tutorial. Part 1 is a demo of the UTRC portal and how you can use it for your research here at TACC. Part 2 is hands-on, setting up Cyberduck and how to upload your data to TACC.
