# Asteroid Impact

### Science Behind the Image

Shown here are two time-steps of a simulation of a 250m asteroid impacting the ocean surface. Water vapor arising from the impact is shown in light blue, asteroid fragments in orange.

### Visualization Behind the Image

Volume rendering combined with calibrated opacity levels, enables visualization of the structures of both the water vapor and asteroid fragments. Enabling scientists to see multiple volumetric structures facilitates understanding of the interaction of the physical materials.
