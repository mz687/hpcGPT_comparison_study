# Stallion

## One of the Highest Resolution Tiled-Displays in the World.

The cluster provides users with the ability to perform visualizations on a large 6x3 tiled display of Samsung 8K monitors: an aggregate resolution of 597 megapixels. This configuration allows for an exploration of visualizations at an extremely high level of detail and quality compared to a typical moderate pixel count projector.

Software developed by TACC staff, such as [DisplayCluster](/research/tacc-research/displaycluster/) and [Massive Pixel Environment (MPE)](/research/tacc-research/massive-pixel-environment/) allow the distributed display to be controlled easily. The cluster allows users access to over 74GB of graphics memory, 1.28TB of system memory, 19TB aggregate local disk storage, and 232 processing cores.

### System Specifications

Stallion's configuration enables the processing of datasets at massive scale, and the interactive visualization of substantial geometries. A large, shared file system is available to enable the storage of terascale size datasets.
