## Graduate Student Fellowship & Undergraduate Research Scholarship FAQ

These answers to frequently asked questions will aid candidates in preparing their applications for the SCIPE AI in Civil Engineering Fellowships.

### General FAQ

[I’m not a US citizen, can I apply?](#1-answer)

Yes; we only require you be enrolled at a US institution and be studying in the US or its territories.

It it important to note two key factors for international students:

* Some countries have tax treaty agreements with the U.S. that exempt specific income amounts of U.S.-sourced income and/or scholarship/fellowship payments from taxation. Refer to the appropriate treaty list on [Tax Treaties for Visiting Scholars](http://global.utexas.edu/isss/advising-services/taxes/tax-treaties) to see if your country has a tax treaty.
* This stipend is not considered employment; this is particularly important for students with an F Visa. Though the stipend amount is paid directly to the accepted Fellow, it is processed as a scholarship/fellowship from The University of Texas at Austin. Fellows are considered a participant in an educational opportunity that is solely for their benefit. As such, the following statements are true:
* The recipient is not required to perform a service, including volunteer services, in exchange for these funds.
* This is not a reimbursement for official university business, including business travel.
* This is not a cash prize, scholarship, nor fellowship given for an employee's job performance or merit.
* The recipient is not an employee with 100% appointment.
