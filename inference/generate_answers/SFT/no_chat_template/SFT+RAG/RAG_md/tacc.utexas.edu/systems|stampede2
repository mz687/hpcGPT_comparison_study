**Stampede2 queues are now closed. The Stampede2 login nodes remain accessible so that you may continue to transfer data to [Stampede3](/systems/stampede3/). See the new [Stampede3 User Guide](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/stampede3/) — [Migrating Data](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/stampede3/#migrating) and [Allocations](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/hpc/stampede3/#intro-allocations) sections — for further information.

## A Single Virtual System That Scientists Can Use To Interactively Share Computing Resources, Data, And Expertise

TACC's Stampede2 is the flagship supercomputer of the [Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS)](https://access-ci.org/). Stampede2 was deployed by TACC in conjunction with vendor partners Dell Inc., Intel Corporation, and Cray Inc., and is operated by a team of cyberinfrastructure experts at TACC, UT Austin, Clemson University, Cornell University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, Indiana University, and Ohio State University.

Stampede2 provides HPC capabilities to thousands of researchers across the U.S. The system entered full production in Fall 2017 as an 18 petaflop system that builds on the successes of the original Stampede cluster it replaced.

Stampede2 is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through award [ACI-1540931](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1540931).

### Stampede2 to Stampede3 Transition

TACC announced the [Stampede3 supercomputer in July 2023](https://tacc.utexas.edu/news/latest-news/2023/07/24/taccs-new-stampede3-advances-nsf-supercomputing-ecosystem/). Below is a timeline of what to expect:

#### Timeline
