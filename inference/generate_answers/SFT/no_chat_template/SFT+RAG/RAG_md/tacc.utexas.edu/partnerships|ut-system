### Program Goals

Through the UTRC Program, UT System has worked to facilitate, stimulate, and support leadership in computational science research across Texas, as well as, attract additional funding and the best faculty and students to UT institutions.

The collaboration between UT System and TACC leverages advanced computing, visualization resources, and support services to enable researchers. TACC staff members also assist research teams in employing the software and expertise necessary to foster educational innovation, and are dedicated to providing the research and development, consulting and training required so users can take full advantage of TACC resources, services and educational programs.

### TACC Symposium for Texas Researchers (TACCSTER)

The annual TACC Symposium for Texas Researchers is a meeting of scientists, engineers, scholars, and students from across the state of Texas who use, and would like to use TACC to advance their research goals.

This meeting is an opportunity for you to showcase your ongoing research involving TACC resources, learn new and useful computing skills from a variety of tutorials, network with other Texas-based researchers, and hear information about the latest TACC systems and services. The annual meeting is typically held in September. Proceedings are available via the [University of Texas Libraries](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/79644).
