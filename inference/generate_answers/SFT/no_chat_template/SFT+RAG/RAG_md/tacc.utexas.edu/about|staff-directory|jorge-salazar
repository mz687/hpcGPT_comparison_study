Jorge Salazar has conducted over a thousand in-depth interviews with scientists in over twelve years for the Austin-based science radio program EarthSky, which broadcast on over 1,200 public and commercial radio stations worldwide, including KUT in Austin, and the Voice of America and XM/Sirius satellite networks.

Before joining TACC in 2014, Salazar was EarthSky's Lead Producer and Co-Host for the 90-second and 8-minute EarthSky Clear Voices for Science podcasts, and the 22-minute science and Austin music program EarthSky-22.

Salazar was a radio producer for EarthSky (Earth & Sky) when in 2003 the National Science Board – advisors to the U.S. President and Congress – awarded Earth & Sky its prestigious public service award for 'its achievements in broadcasting explanations of research and everyday science to a worldwide audience.' Earth & Sky was the first radio program to ever receive this award.

Salazar has been listed as one of the "Top 100 Scientists on Twitter." He has also served on EarthSky's Editorial Board for both English and Spanish content. He has been an invited speaker at The National Academy of Sciences, NASA's Lunar Science Institute, and The Bullock Texas State History Museum.
