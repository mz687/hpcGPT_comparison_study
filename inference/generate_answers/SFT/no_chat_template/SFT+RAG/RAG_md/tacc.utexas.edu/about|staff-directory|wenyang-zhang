Dr. Zhang joined the High-Performance Computing group at the Texas Advanced Computing Center as Research Associate in 2021. He has been collaborating with the DesignSafe community, and many corporations on various projects. His current research interests include high-performance computing applications for natural hazards research such as earthquakes, fault displacement, landslide and liquefaction, scientific machine learning, advanced numerical simulations, and parallel computing.

During 2019-2021, Dr. Zhang worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar within the B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. He made remarkable contributions to developing computational and physical modeling and data analytics methodologies in design and performance assessment of life pipelines and infrastructure systems, to further enhance their resilience and sustainability. In addition, he devised an advanced computational flow for regional-scale nonlinear rupture-to-structure simulation by utilizing TACC's HPC facilities.

Dr. Zhang received his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019. His Ph.D. research focused on earthquake engineering, computational mechanics, and soil-structure interaction.
