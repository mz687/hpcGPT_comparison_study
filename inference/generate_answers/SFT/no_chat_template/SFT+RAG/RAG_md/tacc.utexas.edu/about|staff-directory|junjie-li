Junjie joined TACC in December 2020 as a research associate in High Performance Computing (HPC). He has extensive experience in performance benchmark and tuning, parallel computing and quantum chemistry. Prior to joining TACC, he was an HPC principal system analyst at Indiana University.

Junjie earned his PhD in chemical physics from Indiana University Bloomington. He was a contributor to Gaussian quantum chemistry package and developed several novel electronic structure techniques for real-time ab initio molecular dynamics to simulate quantum nuclear effects in chemical and biological reactions.
