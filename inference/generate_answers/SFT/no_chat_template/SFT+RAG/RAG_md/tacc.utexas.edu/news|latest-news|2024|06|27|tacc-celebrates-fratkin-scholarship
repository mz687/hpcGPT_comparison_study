Congratulations to the second cohort of Susan Fratkin Scholarship recipients!

In May, selected Code@TACC alumni gathered with their families and TACC staff to celebrate the second group of Susan Fratkin Scholarship recipients. Eight students received $500 scholarships to be used for higher education expenses.

“The Fratkin Scholarship banquet gives us a dedicated time to celebrate students,” said Education & Outreach (E&O) Program Manager [Dawn Hunter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawn-hunter-3356a1268/). “We love that our students have the confidence to continue their education journey into college, and the Fratkin scholarship is a small way that we can encourage them to chase their dreams.”

[Sue Fratkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-fratkin-5007871/) — the scholarship’s namesake — is a renowned ambassador for high performance computing (HPC) workforce development. For 26 years, Fratkin served as executive director of the [Coalition for Academic Scientific Computation](https://casc.org/) (CASC). Founded in 1989, CASC is an educational nonprofit organization with over 100 member institutions representing many of the nation's most forward-thinking universities and computing centers.

“This modest award can make such a difference in students’ lives,” Fratkin said. “Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think something so wonderful would be named after me. We’re excited that this scholarship program will be offered for many years to come.”

Funding for these scholarships was made possible by private donors and CASC, which will serve as the scholarship fund’s premiere sponsor through 2028.

“With the Fratkin Scholarship now firmly established, CASC is delighted to see even more talented students beginning their journeys into higher education, ready to make significant contributions to HPC,” said Executive Director [Kathryn Kelley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkelleycmh/). “The achievements of these diverse scholarship recipients highlight the importance of our dedication to excellence in this field.”

Nathan Reyna of Austin Achieve High School enrolled at UT Austin and is set to study Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).

“I’ve always been into tech and engineering, so I’m looking forward to starting at UT in the fall,” Reyna said. “I met former TACC volunteer [Jan Carlos Rubio](https://tacc.utexas.edu/news/latest-news/2023/05/25/codetacc-alumnus-graduates/) at a Code@TACC camp, and he inspired me to pursue a college education in engineering.”

Julianna Hernandez of Austin Achieve High School will study computer science at St. Edward’s University.

Scholarship recipient Dalia Rodriguez of Cedars International Next Generation High School plans to study Automotive Technology at Austin Community College.

“I feel honored to receive this incredible scholarship,” Rodriguez said. “TACC staff have been encouraging and supportive of my dream to one day own an automotive and diesel business.”

Since 2015, TACC's signature Code@TACC camps have served more than 700 students with the majority from African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx backgrounds. Hundreds of these campers have gone on to pursue postsecondary education in STEM fields.

“Code@TACC Camps are intentional about teaching both STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills and life lessons,” said E&O Senior Outreach Program Coordinator [Geoffrey Reid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdreid/). “We want to expose students to experiences that may be new to them and create a welcoming environment that says, ‘You can do it. We believe in you!’”
