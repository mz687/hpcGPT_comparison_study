Radek Bukowski came to Texas Advanced Computing Center from Dell Medical School, where he was a tenured professor and Vice-Chair for Research at the Department of Women's Health. He is Affiliate Faculty Member of the Oden Institute, and Honorary Senior Visiting Fellow at Cambridge University.

He received an MD from Poznan University of Medical Sciences in 1986 and a Ph.D. from Freie Universitaet Berlin in 1994. He completed training in obstetrics and gynecology in Europe and the US. In 1994, he completed a Research Fellowship in Reproductive Endocrinology at the Howard and Georgeanna Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine under the mentorship of Gary Hodgen, Georgeanna, and Howard Jones. After completing a Fellowship in Maternal Fetal Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Dr. Bukowski joined its faculty, rising through the ranks over 17 years and becoming a tenured professor. Yale University then recruited him to become a Professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences, Director of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, and Chief of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the Yale-New Haven Hospital.

Over more than 30 years, Dr. Bukowski's research contributed substantially to obstetrics, human development, computational medicine, and decision-making. His research was supported by multiple grants from NIH and NSF and culminated in a number of high-impact publications. He is the associate editor for computational medicine of the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the leading journal in the field in the world.
