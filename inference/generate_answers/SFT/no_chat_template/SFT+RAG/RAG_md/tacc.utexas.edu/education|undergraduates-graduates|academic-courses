## Educating the next generation through a unique scientific computing curriculum

TACC inspires and educates the next generation of computational scientists through a unique scientific computing curriculum developed specifically for The University of Texas at Austin. The courses are also designed to benefit social scientists, artists, and historians by increasing the public's understanding of the role computing plays in shaping our society.

In partnership with UT Austin, TACC offers **seven undergraduate and graduate level courses in supercomputing** through the Department of Statistics and Data Science in the College of Natural Sciences and the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics in the Cockrell School of Engineering.

* The Natural Sciences curriculum allows students to earn a **Certificate of Scientific Computation** (undergraduate students) or a **Portfolio in Scientific Computation** (graduate students), which is equivalent to earning a minor in the area.
* The Engineering curriculum is designed to help students understand key concepts in scientific software engineering and design in order to build better systems and unlock new scientific discoveries.

TACC researchers, who are experts in high performance computing, teach the courses, and students have the opportunity to apply the theories learned in class on TACC's high performance computing and cloud systems. Students across engineering, science, mathematics, computer science, and liberal arts are welcome.
