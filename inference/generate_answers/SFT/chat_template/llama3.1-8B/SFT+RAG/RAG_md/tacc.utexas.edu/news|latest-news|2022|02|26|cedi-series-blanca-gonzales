The 2020-2021 Computing Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) consisted of in-service teachers of color working together as they deepened their computer science content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and equitable strategies — as well as be supported in their efforts to obtain their computer science (CS) teacher certification.

This is the fourth Q&A profile in the Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) series on teachers' experiences with the CEDI program. Blanca Gonzales serves as a regional manager with the Microsoft Philanthropies TEALS Program in Houston. Prior to that, she spent four years teaching CS to middle school students at Grantham Academy for Aldine ISD in Houston.

We caught up with Gonzales to hear her thoughts on why students should learn CS, her time in the CEDI program, lessons learned from the educators in her cohort, and why she recommends that other teachers join the program.

**EPIC/TACC:** What piqued your interest in CS and STEM? How did you decide to pursue this field as a career?

**Blanca Gonzales:** When I was a high school student, I wanted to learn CS but was told I wasn't the type of student who should bother. That's why I always thought CS was for "smart people." When I became a CS teacher, I knew that I could make a positive impact in the lives of students, which is what I wished had happened to me in high school. Students are hungry for knowledge, and if you give them the resources to be successful, you can change their lives for the better.

**EPIC/TACC:** Do you have a main takeaway from your time in the CEDI initiative?

**Blanca Gonzales:** The teachers in my cohort formed a bond because we all wanted the same thing: to learn CS and teach it to students, so kids can improve their lives. Shortly after completing the CEDI program, I moved from my role as a teacher for Aldine ISD to become a regional manager for Microsoft TEALS in Houston. Now, when I go back to Aldine ISD, I bring not only TEALS lessons but also the knowledge and skills I learned in the CEDI program.

**EPIC/TACC:** You mentioned Microsoft TEALS. Can you tell us about it?

**Blanca Gonzales:** The TEALS program partners professional programmers with educators currently teaching CS. Industry professionals spend a year in a high school classroom, which builds a rapport between them and the students. Through these partnerships, TEALS professionals can inform students about opportunities like internships or scholarships. In my new role, I recruit schools that need support in teaching CS materials and pair them with industry professionals. Depending on how much help a teacher requests, a classroom can have one CS volunteer or as many as four. I also recruit CS professionals from companies in Houston to volunteer at our schools.

**EPIC/TACC:** What do you hope to see for current and future CS students?

**Blanca Gonzales:** I want to help build a pipeline for underrepresented students that flows from the classroom directly into CS careers. I also want to help teachers and administrators learn about resources that are available to students interested in CS. Schools need to develop relationships with businesses to hire students as apprentices or interns. Every company needs CS workers — why can't historically underserved students fill those roles?

**EPIC/TACC:** How has CEDI empowered you to advocate for students of color?

**Blanca Gonzales:** Being a minority working in CS, you don't meet a lot of people who look like you. The diversity of our CEDI cohort made me feel included and seen. Teachers spoke honestly about tough subjects including the challenges students of color face and how to help them. Hearing from teachers about how they wanted to use CS to empower underrepresented students was inspiring. My time in CEDI showed me that I'm not alone in wanting to show students of color they can be successful in CS.

**EPIC/TACC:** Why should other teachers sign up for the CEDI program?

**Blanca Gonzales:** If you participate in the CEDI program, you will find a group of educators passionate about helping students learn CS. Having such a great cohort of teachers made my time in CEDI feel like I was studying alongside family. CS can be difficult, but the CEDI leaders are great at teaching in a way that's easy to digest. After CEDI, I tell students and parents they can learn CS, too, because I'm always learning new things!

**EPIC/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Ms. Gonzales.
