# Stockyard

## A global file system supporting data-driven science.

Stockyard is a global file system that supports data-driven science, and is at the center of TACC's system ecosystem. The file system provides online storage of large datasets used on Stampede2 and Frontera, which can be migrated to Corral or Ranch for further data management and archiving, and is accessible to all of TACC's computing and visualization systems.

Stockyard provides 6.8 petabytes of storage capacity for scientific data, and allows scientists to access their data rapidly through its aggregate bandwidth of greater than 100 gigabytes per second. This balances the storage available to all TACC systems and makes migration between systems and upgrades to new ones more transparent.
