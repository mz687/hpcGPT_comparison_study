The 2020-2021 Computing Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) consisted of in-service teachers of color working together as they deepened their computer science content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and equitable strategies — as well as be supported in their efforts to obtain their computer science (CS) teacher certification.

This is the sixth and final Q&A profile in the Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) series on teachers' experiences with the CEDI program. Celinda Rejino teaches Robotics, Advanced CS, and Introduction to Coding classes at Levelland Middle School for Levelland ISD.

We caught up with Rejino to hear her thoughts on why students should learn CS, her time in the CEDI program, lessons learned from the educators in her cohort, and why she recommends that other teachers join the program.

**EPIC/TACC:** What piqued your interest in CS and STEM? How did you decide to pursue this field as a career?

**Celinda Rejino:** When I was in fourth grade, I couldn't believe there was technology that allowed you to play video games with people around the world. In junior high, I took an html course and designed my first website. When I got to high school, I continued studying html and won a coding award. I majored in math and science education at Texas Tech, but my passion was always in CS. Now, I teach CS, robotics, how to work with drones, and 3D printing at Levelland Middle School — everything has come full circle.

**EPIC/TACC:** Do you have a main takeaway from your time in the CEDI program?

**Celinda Rejino:** Going through the CEDI program felt like a breath of fresh air. It was nice to be among teachers who share the same passion for teaching CS. Working in a small district, there's not many teachers as interested as I am in teaching CS.

**EPIC/TACC:** What do you hope to see for current and future CS students?

**Celinda Rejino:** By teaching CS to our students, we will make them more marketable to future employers. We may not know *exactly* what the future of technology will look like, but if our students learn CS, they will be poised for successful careers in any field.

**EPIC/TACC:** What is one thing that surprised you about participating in CEDI?

**Celinda Rejino:** I'm still reflecting on the lessons learned in the CEDI program. I haven't taken the CS certification exam yet, but I feel like I'm prepared to do so because of everything I learned during my time in the program, which was difficult but rewarding.

**EPIC/TACC:** How has participation in CEDI empowered you to advocate for CS, particularly with students of color, in your school or district?

**Celinda Rejino:** The CEDI program has allowed me to expand my mind and grow within the CS profession through the rigorous curriculum. This in turn has helped me challenge my students, including students of color, to also grow in CS. As a result, I believe Levelland has an even stronger CS program today than it did when I went through the program a year ago.

**EPIC/TACC:** How was the program enhanced by the unique cohort of educators who experienced CEDI with you?

**Celinda Rejino:** Teachers who struggled with the lessons were able to share their frustrations and get help. This helped me see that I wasn't alone. Spending time with high school CS teachers gave me confidence that I can pass the certification exam and teach at a high school level.

**EPIC/TACC:** Why should other teachers sign up for the CEDI program?

**Celinda Rejino:** From content to pedagogy, CEDI is a great program for teachers who want to get certified to teach CS. As a teacher of color, you will learn to have honest discussions about the unique struggles we face.

**EPIC/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Ms. Rejino.
