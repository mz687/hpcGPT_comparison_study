Ian joined TACC as a Research Associate in the Performance and Architecture Group in 2018. Currently, he focuses on system performance analysis and industry standard benchmarking on HPC platforms as well as assisting TACC users with the porting, analysis, and improvement of their research software. Prior to joining TACC, he held a position at the Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies (CREST) at Indiana University where he worked on asynchronous multi-tasking runtime system development and RDMA networking library integration. He also worked as a Research Geophysicist at the Indiana Geological and Water Survey where he involved the collaborative development of a science gateway for simulation and assessment of CO2 capture and storage technologies with Los Alamos National Lab and Pervasive Technology Institute.
