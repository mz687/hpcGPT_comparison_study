### LCCF Internship FAQ

These answers to frequently asked questions will aid candidates in preparing their applications for the LCCF Internship Program.

[I’m not a US citizen, can I apply?](#1-answer)

Yes; we only require you be enrolled at a U.S. institution and be studying in the U.S. or its territories.

It is important to note two key factors for international students:

* Some countries have tax treaty agreements with the U.S. that exempt specific income amounts of U.S.-sourced income and/or scholarship/fellowship payments from taxation. Refer to the appropriate treaty list on Tax Treaties for Visiting Scholars to see if your country has a tax treaty.
* This stipend is not considered employment; this is particularly important for students with an F Visa. Though the stipend amount is paid directly to the accepted Intern, it is processed as a scholarship/fellowship from The University of Texas at Austin. Interns are considered a participant in an educational opportunity that is solely for their benefit. As such, the following statements are true:
  + The recipient is not required to perform a service, including volunteer services, in exchange for these funds.
  + This is not a reimbursement for official university business, including business travel.
  + This is not a cash prize, scholarship, nor fellowship given for an employee's job performance or merit.
  + The recipient is not an employee with 100% appointment.

[How will I be notified if I am accepted or rejected?](#2-answer)

We will contact you using the email address you provided. Please be sure to provide an email that you will be able to check during the time that decisions will be made. If we do not hear back from you in the allotted time, we will give your internship to an alternate candidate.

[How many interns are being selected, per cohort?](#4-answer)
