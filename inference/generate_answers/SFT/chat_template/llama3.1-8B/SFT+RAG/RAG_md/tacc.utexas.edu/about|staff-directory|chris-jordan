Chris Jordan joined TACC in April 2008 to work on a variety of issues related to storage and I/O for high-performance computing, as well as long-term digital preservation issues. He currently leads the Data Management and Collections group, and is responsible for deploying research data infrastructure to serve the University of Texas System campuses and the national community. He has led data infrastructure activities for the National Science Foundation's TeraGrid and XSEDE projects. Before joining TACC, Chris spent four years at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, where he helped develop and deploy the GPFS-WAN global file system currently in production across multiple TeraGrid resource providers. He and his collaborators have published and spoken widely about the project. Chris has nearly ten years of experience working directly with some of the largest supercomputers and storage systems in the world, and has worked with a variety of architectures and scientific applications.
