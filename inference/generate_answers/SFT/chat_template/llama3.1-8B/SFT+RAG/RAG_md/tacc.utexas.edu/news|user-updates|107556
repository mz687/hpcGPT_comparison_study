# Stockyard Fluctuations 11 November 2024

We have been experiencing issues with Stockyard over the weekend and into today. The root cause has been found and the file system is now stable.   

These slow downs have been the result of large scale parallel Conda jobs. If you ware running Conda on a large scale, we request that you submit a ticket so that your code can be reviewed: <https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/tickets>  

Thank you for the patience and cooperation.
