# Rattler

## A Custom-Engineered Matrix Display

The Human Data Interaction Lab at the Advanced Computing Building features Rattler, a custom-engineered 7x3, 189 megapixel matrix display with a 21 node cluster and graphics cards. The Rattler visualization system can be reconfigured to allow more freedom to display large data sets, with detachable columns that allow multiple displays. A tracking system with pinpoint precision permits usability tests, as well as tracking of users in and around the system.

This reconfiguration design enables researchers to create an immersive experience - without needing a conventional immersive system - to better share and explore their visualizations.
