# Ozone Concentration in East Texas Due to Emissions in Houston

### Science Behind the Image

This visualization shows simulations of ozone concentrations in eastern Texas. Emissions in Houston cause ozone concentrations to rise in other parts of the state, particularly in central and north Texas; thus, it is apparent that emissions from one city can affect ozone levels in an entire region. These simulations use various sources of data including satellite observations and land-based measurements.

### Visualization Behind the Image

TACC staff developed a custom OpenGL application to visualize the data sets. This application combines geospatial data with the simulations to produce time-series animations of the ozone concentration across Texas. Cutting planes and isosurfaces show the ozone concentration in units of parts-per-billion.
