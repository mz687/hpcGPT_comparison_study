Welcome to TACC’s Black History Month series! Throughout February, TACC talks with teachers, students, and others on what it means to be Black in computer science and STEM education. Join us as Black teachers describe their experiences with WeTeach\_CS, the program’s impact, and the importance of teaching CS in schools. In addition, Black students and professionals will detail their experiences in Education & Outreach programs.

Stay tuned throughout February as new stories post each week!
