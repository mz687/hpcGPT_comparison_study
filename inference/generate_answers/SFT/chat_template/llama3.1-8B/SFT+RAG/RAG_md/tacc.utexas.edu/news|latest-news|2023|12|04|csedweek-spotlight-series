The [WeTeach\_CS](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/) program at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) (TACC) educates, empowers, and inspires K-12 educators and advocates to realize the vision of computer science (CS) for all. WeTeach\_CS is part of The University of Texas at Austin’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) group within TACC, which works to advance CS education for all in Texas and beyond.

In 2023, TACC’s [Education & Outreach](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/k-12-students/) (E&O) team completed its eighth year of hosting Code@TACC, the center’s signature summer residential program for high school students. Code@TACC has served more than 600 students with the majority from African American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx backgrounds. Hundreds of these campers have gone on to pursue postsecondary education in STEM fields.
