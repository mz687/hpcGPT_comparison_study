# Tapis

### Overview

The Tapis Framework provides a hosted, unified web-based API for securely managing computational workloads across institutions so that experts can focus on their research instead of the technology needed to accomplish it.

The advanced computing infrastructure landscape has evolved tremendously with many sophisticated capabilities for tackling the world's most challenging computing problems. But with that sophistication comes complexity.
