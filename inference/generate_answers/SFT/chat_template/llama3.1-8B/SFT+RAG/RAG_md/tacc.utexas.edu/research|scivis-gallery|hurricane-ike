# Hurricane Ike

### Science Behind the Image

Throughout the 2008 hurricane season, the Texas Advanced Computing Center was an active participant in a NOAA research effort to develop next-generation hurricane models. Teams of scientists relied on TACC's Ranger supercomputer to test high-resolution ensemble hurricane models, and to track evacuation routes from data streams on the ground and from space.

### Visualization Behind the Image

Using up to 40,000 processing cores at once, researchers simulated both global and regional weather models and received on-demand access to some of the most powerful hardware in the world enabling real-time, high-resolution ensemble simulations of the storm. This visualization of Hurricane Ike shows the storm developing in the gulf and making landfall on the Texas coast.
