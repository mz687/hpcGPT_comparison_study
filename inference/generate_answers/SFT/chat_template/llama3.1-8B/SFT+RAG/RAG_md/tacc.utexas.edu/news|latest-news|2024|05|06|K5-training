This April, TACC’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) team held its inaugural [Launch\_K5 CS](https://utakeit.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/Launch_K5CS/) training, a new series of professional development opportunities designed to equip K-5 educators with the tools and training to seamlessly integrate the Technology Applications (Tech Apps) TEKS into their teaching practices, preparing students for success in the digital age.

In 2022, Texas state officials adopted new Tech Apps TEKS required to be implemented by the start of the 2024-2025 school year. The updated standards include a focus on skills like computational thinking, creativity, innovation, data literacy, digital citizenship, and cybersecurity. To give context, the last round of TEKS revisions began more than 12 years ago and was implemented in the 2012-2013 school year. In addition, there are now TEKS for each grade level, not just grade bands throughout the elementary levels.

“Training teachers on the new TEKS ensures that our educational system stays relevant in today’s rapidly advancing world,” said [Judy Lau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judyfaithlau/), EPIC’s computer science (CS) professional development coordinator and a former teacher. “After this training, we hope teachers are empowered to embrace computational thinking and technology in ways that enhance their students’ learning experiences.”

A total of 26 educators from around the state and four trainers participated in the Austin training. Attendees responded positively to the hands-on, interactive nature of the training and in-depth breakdowns of how to use an inquiry model to integrate Tech Apps TEKS into lesson plans. Training included sessions on integrating the new TEKS into core curricula, micro:bits, Scratch and Scratch Jr., and artificial intelligence.

Educators who complete the three-day course and train a minimum of 30 teachers in their region or district will receive a $3,000 stipend — a small “thank you” for all their hard work in contributing to training the next generation of CS students.

The revised standards teach students about cyberbullying terminology, which is required by [Texas Education Code (TEC) §28.002(z)](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/ED/htm/ED.28.htm#28.002:%7E:text=(z)%20%20The%20State%20Board%20of%20Education). The new middle-school TEKS include practical technology concepts where students evaluate and select appropriate methods for an independent project and solve common hardware and software problems using troubleshooting strategies. New creativity and innovation standards instruct students to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the role of technology throughout history and its impact on societies.

Feedback from teachers who participated was overwhelmingly positive.

“I came away from this training with lesson integration resources created by Launch\_K5 and resources from VEX, micro:bit, Code.org and others supporting computational thinking, coding, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence,” said [Kay Orr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kayorr/), an instructional technology specialist in Rockwall ISD. “This training will help our district in documenting verification of competency to teach the new TEKS.”

“Thanks to Launch K-5, our teachers will undergo comprehensive training to equip them with the knowledge and confidence needed to nurture creative, critical-thinking students who utilize practical technology concepts to positively impact our community,” said [Vashunda Warren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vashunda-warren-ed-d-2b1a1274/), School Leader at Visionary STEM Academy. “Integrating computer science concepts into our curriculum is crucial, as it fosters computational thinking, cultivates responsible digital citizenship, and prepares students to thrive in future STEM-related careers.”

EPIC Partnership Coordinator [Sheryl Roehl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheryl-roehl-23739715/) praised what she calls the “notable evolution” in the teaching of STEM content.

“Since I started teaching in 1973, education has transitioned from teaching basic facts to emphasizing hands-on, minds-on learning with a focus on interdisciplinary connections and real-world applications,” Roehl said. “Access to advanced technology and resources in schools was limited, but now, there's a greater emphasis on leveraging technology as a tool for learning.”

A total of 26 educators from around the state and four trainers participated in the Austin training.

“With concepts like variables, loops, sequences, and conditionals, the new TEKS can seem overwhelming to educators who are teaching new standards and their core subjects,” Lau said. “This training is designed to help educators better understand the new standards and how to effectively implement this training in the classroom.”

*This project was part of the Texas CS Pipeline (TXCSP), a statewide K-12 computer science teacher professional development initiative coordinated by TACC with the support of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Funding for the TXCSP was provided by the Texas Legislature.*
