The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) has been recognized in the 21st edition of the HPCwire Readers’ and Editors' Choice Awards presented at the 2024 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC24) in Atlanta.

**TACC was recognized with the following honor: Workforce and Diversity Inclusion Leadership Award** 

“TACC is pleased to be recognized in the HPCwire Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards for the 13th consecutive year,” said Dan Stanzione, executive director at TACC. “The Technology Training for Non-Traditionals program, designed and led by Nathaniel Mendoza, is an opportunity to increase participation from individuals across various education and experience backgrounds to become part of the cyberinfrastructure workforce.”

“Hands-on training is provided before and during the SC Conference Series for [SCinet](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/scinet/), which becomes the most powerful and advanced network on Earth. It is designed, built, and administered by up to 200 volunteers. Participants receive unique exposure and experience being part of this team,” Stanzione said.

The coveted annual HPCwire Readers’ Choice Awards are determined through a nomination and voting process with the global HPCwire community, as well as selections from the HPCwire editors. The awards are an annual feature of the publication and constitute prestigious recognition from the HPC community. They are revealed each year to kick off the annual supercomputing conference, which highlights high performance computing, networking, storage, and data analysis.

“This year, as we celebrate HPCwire’s 35th anniversary covering HPC and SC, and as we are at the advent of an HPC-led AI transformation, the 2024 Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards certainly reflect these exciting events,” said Tom Tabor, CEO of Tabor Communications, publishers of HPCwire.

“Throughout the world, we see grand challenge problems that can only be explored and solved because of HPC, now aided by AI. Rarely do these accomplishments come to light, much less are they recognized for their contribution to society,” Tabor added. “Between our worldwide readership of HPC experts and the most renowned panel of editors in the industry, the Readers’ and Editors’ Choice Awards represent resounding recognition of the deep and varied HPC accomplishments throughout the world. Our sincerest gratitude and hearty congratulations go out to all the winners.”
