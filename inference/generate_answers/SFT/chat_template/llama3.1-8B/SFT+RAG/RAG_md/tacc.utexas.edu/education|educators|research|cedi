## Computing Educator Diversity Initiative

CEDI consists of in-service educators who are historically underrepresented in CS that will work within a community of practice as together they deepen their CS content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and equitable strategies.

### Overview

One of the most effective ways to help students build a CS identity is to give them role models with whom they can identify. The National Science Foundation has identified the following groups as historically underrepresented in computer science: women, persons with disabilities, Blacks and African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The CEDI project will recruit educators who identify with these student populations to become certified high school computer science teachers and thus serve as role models for the students who have been historically excluded from the computing profession.

* The Computer Educator Diversity Initiative (CEDI) will recruit educators who identify with these student populations to become certified high school computer science teachers and thus serve as role models for the students who have been historically excluded from the computing profession.
* CEDI consists of in-service Texas-certified teachers who will work within a community of practice as they deepen together their CS content knowledge, pedagogical skills, and equitable strategies and are supported to obtain their high school CS teacher certification.

**ANY APPLICANT MUST BE A CERTIFIED TEACHER IN TEXAS TO BE ELIGIBLE.**
