The WeTeach\_CS program at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) partners with educators and administrators across Texas to educate, empower, and inspire K-12 teachers and advocates to realize the vision of computer science (CS) for all.

[Ruthelen Robinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthelen/) is a Career and Technical Education (CTE) STEM-Engineering Educator for Spring Branch Independent School District. Previously, Robinson worked as a CTE (Engineering and Architecture) teacher for Fort Bend ISD.

We caught up with Robinson to hear about her experiences as a Black person working in CS, her perspective on the WeTeach\_CS program, and the importance of teaching CS in schools.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What inspired you to work in CS education? Was it a dearth of Black teachers in CS classrooms?

**Ruthelen Robinson:** In the 1980s, I was that one Black kid who had to get special permission to take the new CS class my senior year in high school. In the 1990s, I was the one Black IT consultant working on a project for a top global consulting firm. I often wondered why I seemed to always be the only one. Was I that smart? Not by a long shot, but I had support and encouragement from Black role models dedicated to helping other Black students be ready for the future. Sadly, not every Black child is as fortunate. The pivot point in my journey from IT consultant to educator was the day my daughter called from college and said, “School didn’t prepare me for this.” As both of my parents were teachers, I chose to continue their legacy of helping young Black students to be future-ready by becoming an educator.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** How did you first learn about the WeTeach\_CS program?

**Ruthelen Robinson:** My CS mentor Carolyn Nevills and I worked in industry before transitioning to education. As she prepared to retire from the classroom, she noted how WeTeach\_CS professional development courses helped her keep up with industry trends so she could more effectively teach her students. She also recommended I attend a WeTeach\_CS Summit to help boost my engineering curriculum.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** What advice would you give a Black teacher new to teaching computer science/STEM?

**Ruthelen Robinson:** Teach with intent and purpose. Bring awareness to the plethora of opportunities that await students of color and showcase Black professionals making strides in CS careers. Encourage students of color to think deeper, going beyond the obvious, and present opportunities for Black students to develop their skills. Everything you teach should focus on being real, relevant, and relatable. In the classrooms of the 80s and even now, there’s a scarcity of Black faces teaching CS. When I was in college, there weren’t many Black professors teaching my CS classes. Nearly 40 years later, more CS classes are being offered and more diverse students are in those classes, but the faces of the teachers haven’t changed very much.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Why should Black teachers consider WeTeach\_CS as a program and philosophy?

**Ruthelen Robinson:** Black teachers should leverage WeTeach\_CS resources in all courses they teach to help fix broken systems and increase participation among Black students. Black students being able to see themselves in CS careers will make a difference to this generation because the technology of today is not the same as it was in the 70s and 80s. We should want Black students to be prepared for CS careers and be able to use their creativity to share technology with the world.

**WeTeach\_CS/TACC:** Thank you for your time and contributions to teaching CS and STEM, Ms. Robinson.

WeTeach\_CS is part of The University of Texas at Austin’s Expanding Pathways in Computing (EPIC) group within TACC, which works to advance CS education for all in Texas and beyond.

Are you an educator thinking about earning a CS teaching certification? The WeTeach\_CS [Certification Incentive Program](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/weteachcs/certification/) provides a $1,000 stipend to any Texas educator who earns their certification. This stipend represents a small “thank you” to the educators bringing CS to a diverse range of students.

Explore the state of CS education at your school and in your district with the [Texas CS Education Data Dashboard](//tacc.utexas.edu/education/educators/data-dashboard/) from the EPIC research team. The dashboard offers an interactive look at CS enrollment rates, access equity, and more.
