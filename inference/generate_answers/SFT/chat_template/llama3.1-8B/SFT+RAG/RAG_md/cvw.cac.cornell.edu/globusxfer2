[Globus](https://www.globus.org/) is a research data management system that is available on
[Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/) systems.
It provides fast, reliable and secure file transfers and data sharing, as well as publication and discovery functionality.

This topic introduces some advanced subjects for Globus data transfer functionality:

* [The Globus Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.globus.org/cli/)
* Using Globus CLI commands in scripts
* Creating and configuring personal Globus endpoints

If you are new to Globus, you should begin your learning with
the introductory [Globus Data Transfer](/globusxfer) topic, which covers the basics of:

* Creating Globus accounts
* Transferring files through the Globus web interface

##### Objectives

After you complete this topic, you should be able to:

* Perform data transfers using the Globus Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Use the Globus CLI commands in scripts
* Create and manage a Globus endpoint on a personal computer

##### Prerequisites

* Complete the basic [Globus Data Transfer topic](/globusxfer).
* Have a familiarity with basic [Linux shell commands](/linux), in particular those commands that work with files and folders.

##### Requirements

System requirements include:

* Have a [TACC Portal](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/) username.
  Readers without a username should Create a [TACC User Portal account](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request).
* Have an allocation on one or more TACC resources.
  Visit [TACC's Allocation Guide](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/allocations-overview) to learn about obtaining a resource allocation.
* Obtain a [Globus ID](/globusxfer/globus-accounts/globus-id),
  which can be [linked to your other Globus accounts](/globusxfer/globus-accounts/linking-accounts).

If the reader does not have access to any TACC resources, the topic's information can be adapted
to work with other Globus servers by substituting
the correct organizational login information and endpoint names.
